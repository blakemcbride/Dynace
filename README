This is the Dynace Object Oriented Extension to C.

It contains the following enhancements over the previous releases:

	Added the following classes:

		Exception handling classes
			Abort
			Condition
			Error
			Restart
			SeriousCondition
			SimpleRestart
			SimpleWarning
			Warning
		XML DOM & XPath Support
		WeakPointer
		ObjectPool
		Mime handling

Although I don't believe it is documented, in addition to cooperative
threads, Dynace supports native threads under Win32 and could easily
be enhanced to support Posix threads.

The manual was complete with the last release but hasn't been updated
with the new classes yet, although there have been enhancements made
to it.

BTW, this system is very well tested and used in large development
shops with many developers every day for the last ten years.  It is
rock solid and, IMO, a valuable tool.

See docs\DESCRIBE.txt for a basic description of the system.

See docs\ORIENT.txt for a description of the components and their
location.

See docs\BUILD.txt for instructions on building the system.

Please see docs\LICENSE.txt for licensing information.

Once the system is installed see docs\INDEX.txt for a description of
included documentation files.
