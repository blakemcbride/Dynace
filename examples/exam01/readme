This example demonstrates the minimum steps necessary to compile and
link a program which correctly initializes the Dynace system.

The remaining instructions in this file should be followed for
all the other examples.  They will not be repeated.


To compile the example with the Microsoft compiler
use the following command:

	nmake -f makefile.msc

In addition, the following command can be used to build with debugging
information:

	nmake -f makefile.msc  DEBUG=1


To compile the example under UNIX/Linux with the GNU C compiler use:

	make 

The make process will create a stand-alone executable named main.exe
which may be executed to run the example.


To return the directory to its initial state (delete all the created
files) use the following:

	dnake -f makefile.msc  clean



Note that the file ..\list.txt contains the most up-to-date list of example
programs.

After this example, you will want to continue in numeric order with
all the example programs located at:

	examples/exam??/readme

(where ?? is the example number)
