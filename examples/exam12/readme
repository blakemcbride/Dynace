This example builds on the previous example with the addition of two
methods/generics and modifies the main program to use them.

All external access to a class's methods is done through generic functions
(or generics for short).  Generics are shared among all classes who associate
methods to similar generics.  However, methods are unique to the classes
which define them,  except that their functionality may be inherited by
subclassing.

When a generic is evoked, the generic determines the class of the
first argument and then executes the method which is associated with
a particular generic/class combination.  If an association is not found,
the superclasses of the class of the first argument are searched.

Instance and class variables may only be directly accessed by methods
defined in the same class as the variables.  Subclasses may not directly
access class or instance variables which have been defined in a
superclass.  This causes very tight encapsulation.

(To build see the readme file in the first example.)
