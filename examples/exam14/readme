This example illustrates the definition and use of class variables and
class methods.  It also shows how the vNew and gDispose methods can be
defined.

Class variables differ from instance variables in that there is only one
copy of class variables and they are associated directly with the class
object (as opposed to instance objects).  Therefore, when invoking class
methods the first argument is always a class - not an instance.

What this example actually does is to define a class variable which
automatically keeps track of the number of instances a particular
class has in existence.  The main program creates and then destroys a
number of instances while displaying the number of existing instances
on a periodic basis.

(To build see the readme file in the first example.)
