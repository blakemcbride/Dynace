This example demonstrates the minimum steps necessary in order to
create a new class.

Notice the addition of class1.d. This file defines and implements a new
class.  Each new class is usually defined and implemented in a single
independent file with a .d extension.  So if you create five new
classes, there will be five .d files which implement the new classes. 
Note that any number of files may use or sub-class from any
given class.

The Dynace Pre-Processor (dpp) is used to read in class files (which end
in .d), generate generics files (generics.c & .h), and create .c souce
files corresponding to the .d class files. The .c files which are
generated from the .d files are compiled by your normal C compiler to
generate linkable object files.  This program also ensures the argument
consistancy between methods and generics.  If a discrepancy is detected,
a message is displayed and the build process terminates.

The elaborate makefile is used to insure the correct and minimum number
of files get processed whenever a file is changed.  It should, however,
be easy to modify by changing the variables at the beginning of the
makefile.

(To build see the readme file in the first example.)
