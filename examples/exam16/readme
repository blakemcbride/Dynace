This example illustrates the procedure necessary to initialize
instance variables while creating a new instance (via gNew).

Class1.d is modified to give its New method the additional functionality,
and main.c is modified to utilize this changed interface to the
New method.

This example is a duplicate of the previous example except that it shows
a dirty and slightly more efficient method of accessing instance variables
from within a class method.

(To build see the readme file in the first example.)
