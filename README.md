  * classes, instances, methods, & generic functions

  * polymorphism
  * inheritance (multiple)
* fully meta-class based (like Smalltalk or CLOS)
* dynamic binding and dispatching through generic functions (like CLOS)

### Dynace:

* written in standard C
* includes over 300 pages of documentation (https://blakemcbride.github.io/Dynace/manual/Dynace.pdf)
