  * classes, instances, methods, & generic functions
  * encapsulation
  * polymorphism
  * (multiple) inheritance
* fully meta-class based (like Smalltalk or CLOS)

* cooperative threads (also supports native threads)
* full class library
* optional Win32 GUI development system (portable through WINE)
* interfaces with Java, ODBC, OLE

* includes over 600 pages of documentation in two user manuals (https://github.com/blakemcbride/Dynace/blob/master/manual/Dynace.pdf and https://github.com/blakemcbride/Dynace/blob/master/manual/WDS.pdf)
* step-by-step tutorials
* using classes involves no new syntax elements to standard C
* easily added to existing C code

### Dynace is portable across:

* 16, 32 & 64 bit environments
