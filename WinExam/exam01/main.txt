	    All operations are performed through Dynace generic functions.
	    The first argument to any generic function will always be a class
	    object or an instance object which was returned from another
	    generic call.  Generic functions always start with a lower case
	    letter followed with an upper case letter.  The first letter will
	    either be 'g', 'v', or 'm'.  The ones which start with 'g' (which
	    stands for Generic) are the most common.  These are generic
	    function with full compile-time argument checking enabled.  
	    Functions which start with 'v' (which stands for Variable
	    argument) allow variable number of arguments and therefore cannot
	    be checked at compile-time.  Although, when possible, arguments
	    are validated at runtime.  Generics beginning with 'm' (which
	    stands for Macro) are actually macros which translate into normal
	    ('g') generics with the same name.  They are used to avoid the
	    clutter of common typecasts.  

	    The object returned by this vNew operation represents the new
	    window created.  This window is an instance of the MainWindow
	    class.  From this point forward all operations which are to
	    effect the new window should be performed on the win object.  */
