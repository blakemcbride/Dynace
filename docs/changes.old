----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes done for 4.x

6/17/95		Removed need for jumpto.asm by adding the ability to
		generate the appropriate generics - this necessatated
		variable argument methods to be handled differently due
		to an additional level of abstraction (not true - fixed!)
		- this also breaks the old way of cacheing variable argument
		methods	(not true - fixed!)

		Added support for C++ inline generics - controled by a new
		-S option in dpp

		Added GetArg macro to get arguments in variable arg
		situations

		Renamed vNew::Array to gNewArray

6/19/95		Fixed bug in Dup::Array

		Removed Genericm, cMethod and iMethod macros

		Renamed dynace.h to dynl.h

		Added ability to macro guard typedefs in generics.h files

		Reduced the possiblity of dpp clobering needed files by
		performing some file extension checks.

		Made changes in dpp to recognise the .dyn extension as a
		.d file also.

		Renamed InitDynace to InitKernel

		Renamed InitClasses to InitDynace

		Renamed usesClass to InitClass

		Added the ability to support "" or <> include syntax on
		generated includes

		Changed gIndex::Array and gNewArray::Array interface
		(there was a problem with the WATCOM compiler)

6/30/95		Added dpp Strategy #4 (C++ inlines except for variable
		argument generics)

		Added the objrtn type which is basically an object without
		the volatile.  Changed dpp to make all methods and generics
		which return an object to be auto-converted to return objrtn.
		This was needed for the GNU compiler.

		Cleaned up all GNU/Wall/C++ warnings

		Updated unix makefiles to prevent auto removal of .c
		intermediate files.

7/1/95		Changed all vNew generics (except true vararg methods) into
		unique gNewXXX generics as follows:

			vNew::Character -> gNewWithChar
			vNew::Double -> gNewWithDouble
			vNew::File -> gOpenFile
			vNew::IntegerAssociation -> gNewWithIntObj
			vNew::LinkList -> gNew
			vNew::LinkSequence -> gNewWithObj
			vNew::LinkValue -> gNewWithObj
			vNew::LongInteger -> gNewWithLong
			vNew::LookupKey -> gNewWithObj
			vNew::LinkObjectSequence -> gNewWithObj
			vNew::LowFile -> gOpenLowFile
			vNew::ObjectAssociation -> gNewWithObjObj
			vNew::Pointer -> gNewWithPtr
			vNew::Set -> gNewWithInt
			vNew::SetSequence -> gNewSetSeq
			vNew::ShortInteger -> gNewWithInt
			vNew::StringAssociation -> gNewWithStrObj
			vNew::String -> gNew / gNewWithStr / gNewWithObj
			vNew::UnsignedShortInteger -> gNewWithUnsigned
			vNew::Pipe -> gNew / gNewWithStrInt
			vNew::Semaphore -> gNew / gNewSemaphore
			vNew::Thread -> gNewThread
			vNew::Method -> gNewMethod
			vNew::Class -> gNewClass
			vNew::Generic -> gNewWithStr
			vNew::Behavior -> vNew / gNew

		Renamed the old gNewClass::Class to gNewStdClass
	
		Fixed ShouldNotImplement::Object and SubclassResponsibility::
		Object to work correctly with class objects as well as
		instance objects.

		Changed Dispose::Constant to return self instead of NULL.

		Added gNew::Set, gNew::String, gNew::Pipe, gNew::Semaphore,
		gNew::Number which use reasonable defaults.

		Added new generic syntax to allow for the creation of methods
		which are associated with generics which have argument
		checking and _optionally_ generics which have been overloaded
		(and thefore have no compile time checking).  This is
		controlled by the -X dpp option.  The overloaded generics are
		indicated in the method definition by surrounding the
		generic name in <>

		Added (optional) overloaded generics - vNew, vFindXXX, vRemove,
		vFormat, vAdd

		Added vNew::Behavior.

		Added gShouldNotImplement call to several classes which
		shouldn't implement gNew,


7/4/95		Changed acceptable extensions to .d .dd .n .nn
		(dropped .dyn)

		Made .dd and .nn create .cc (instead of .c) file

		Removed accidental use of C++ keyword (overload) in dpp

		Added dummy code to make dpp generate vNew generic from
		kernel.c

		Added -Isc, -Iac, -Ish and -Iah flags to allow inclusion of
		system and application include files in either generics.c
		or generics.h

7/8/95		Fixed bug in new -I?? dpp option

		Added gInit() and gAlloc()

		Changed gInit::Link to gInitLink

		Implemented fast-wide caching scheme
		(dpp option -F and compile all source with FASTWIDE defined)
		
7/10/95		Fixed a bug in the garbage collector

		Added assembler support for the GC under i386 & unix
		(no more volatile needed in that environment)

		Made gen(super) be the same as gen(super self)
		(self is implied)

		Converted all .d files to use new super syntax

		Enhanced dpp to allow (via compile time directive) full
		dependency (and testing) of the garbage collector

7/11/95		Changed gMaxMemUsed::Dynace to gMaxAfterGC

		Added gMaxMemUsed::Dynace

7/11/95		Made changes to avoid "variable not used" warnings

7/17/95		Made changes so all the InitClass functions are now static.
		Therefore, the only thing externally accessable to a class
		is now the class object itself.

7/18/95		Fixed a few anomolies associated with the 7/17 code.

		Removed two compiler warnings

7/22/95		Added automatic and lazy initialization of classes!
		This caused the removal of changes made on 7/17/95.
		This also causes Dynace to only and automatically
		link in the minimum number of classes - only the
		ones you actually use regardless of what's in
		generics.h. Class objects are now macros which
		init the class if it's not already.

		Changed default method names from m_generic to
		class_generic (where "class" is the name of the class
		being defined).  This makes debugging a lot easier.

		Added SMALL_FW macro to cause the fast-wide cache
		to use smaller/faster generics by eliminating object
		checking and threading.

		Renamed imethod, cmethod, etc to imeth, cmeth in generated
		.c files

		The following macros have been removed because they are
		uneeded and conflict with future goals:  cName, ivSize,
		cvSize, instanceVars, classVars, cvsPtr, accessCVs, cvType

		Class and instance variables are now typedef's

		Changed kernel data structure to conform to new conventions

7/23/95		Ported all the language examples to Dynace 4.x

7/25/95		Made changes to support the move to multiple classes in a
		single file by requiring the class to be specified, instead
		of assumed, with some macros.

		Added class argument to iMethodFor and cMethodFor.

		Switched to the following naming convention:

			String		class object with auto init
			String_c	the class object
			String_t	String type (object)
			String_cv	class variable pointer
			String_cv_t	class variable type
			String_iv_t	instance variable type
			String_initialize()  class init function
			gNew_t		generic type
			gNew_g		generic object
			String_im_gDispose default instance method name
			String_cm_gNew     default class method name
			String_cvm_vNew    overloaded class method
			String_ivm_vNew    overloaded instance method

		Added GetIVs and GetCVs macros to get instance/class variable
		pointers while taking the class as an argument.

		dpp now generates code using GetIVs instead of accessIVs

		dpp now generates class_initialize() instead of
		InitClass(class)

		Added gInstanceSize::Behavior and gStackAlloc::Behavior
		generics and StackAlloc macro

		Added the ability to allocate objects from the stack.
		These objects require no disposal or GC.

7/26/95		Added dpp support for "::", "->*", ".*", "::*" C++ operators

		Fixed a potental infinite-recursion problem when initializing
		classes.

		Fixed a bug in IsObj() caused by the new stack based object
		code.

		Fixed memmove (for sparc) code to be more ANSI standard

		Enhanced all unix makefiles

7/28/95		Compiled everything including dpp for MSC 32 bit

8/2/95		Made changes to examples 1,9,20,32 to make them more clear

		Added the dropunx.sh shell script

		Fixed ?m?Pointer macros to correctly typecast the result
		and modified the system to use it.

		Unix make changed to build and install dpp prior to generics
		directory

		Added thread inhibit code to dpp's generation of init
		class functions.

		Verified that some anomily (bug) in GCC 2.7.0 breaks the
		threader.

8/8/95		Made some kernel name changes

		Enhanced unix top level makefile to automatically remove
		cr/lf sequence from source files

		Made delcr.c ANSI C

		Added addcr.c to convert files back to DOS format

		Enhanced top level makefile to be able to put DOS file name
		conventions back in

8/8/95		Added a class argument to the oSuper, iSuper, cSuper macros
		in preparation to be able to access external instance variables
		and modified dpp to generate the new syntax

		Added the ability for dpp to create a .iv and .cv file

		Added makefiles to support one-header-per-class
		with the main Dynace dist.

		Enhanced top level makefile.unx to convert the system to the
		optional format (if you select multiple-header-setup target)
		
8/9/95		Added the ability to cause dpp not to generate class
		initialization functions.

		Changed dpp to downcase file names in #line directives when
		run from DOS.

8/10/95		Converted kernel classes from .c to .d files

		Moved all dummy code (for dpp to scan) from kernel.c to
		the correct .d files.  You no longer scan kernel.c to
		create the generics file.

		Removed all use of the makeThenAccess macro and the macro
		itself

8/11/95		dpp now macro guards .iv and .cv files it generates

		Changed dpp to include .iv and .cv files when they are
		generated as opposed to duplicating the typedef definition.

		Enabled "public" and "private" keywords before a defclass.
		public defclass causes .iv and .cv files to be created.

		Updated kernel makefiles for all DOS compilers

8/12/95		Broke dpp -n flag into -nai and -mgt flags

		Update all DOS makefiles and created a master makefile for m32


8/21/95		Fixed bug in top level makefile.unx which caused files to
		be processed in the wrong order

		Enhanced unix makefile to be able to build with different
		options.

		STARTED WDS PORT!

		Renamed:

			OpenFile::FileDialog -> GetOpenFile
			SaveFile::FileDialog -> GetSaveFile

8/23/95		Made some major changes in order for dpp to automatically
		generate cover functions in _all_ cases in which a method
		pointer would have a different argument list then the one
		declared by the programmer.  The generated cover function
		would correctly handle the argument list and call the correct
		method.  The cover function and programmer defined method are
		now both stored.  The correct one is returned when evoking
		a method depending on the curcumstance.

		Added an argument to gNewMethod.

		Added two new macros:  ivMethodFor and cvMethodFor.

		As before _FindMethod returns a pointer to the method defined
		by the programmer (for use by the generic), but now
		_FindMethod2 and gFindMethod return the cover function
		associated with a method if one exists.  It returns the
		programmer defined method otherwise.

		Got the Windows Development System working!

8/24/95		Made change in FASTWIDE cache configuration to take advantage
		of the new dpp code generation (this fixed an undetected bug
		in the previous FASTWIDE stuff that made it not work with
		variable argument or overloaded methods).  UNTESTED!

		Added an option to dpp to eliminate #line directives

		Changed the oSuper macro to generate smaller code

		Plugged a small memory leak in ostream.d (DPP)

		Changed the #line stuff to point to the generated C file
		whenever corresponding lines don't exist in the .d file.

		Took advantage of the fact that just naming a class with a
		semicolon causes the class to be initialized to get rid of
		calls to Class_initialize() or InitClass(Class).  They are
		now simply  Class;

		Removed dpp's description of its -d option

9/10/95		Removed garbage line in dpp help message

		Fixed portability problems with overloaded generics

9/16/95		Make change in startup.mk file to allow dmake to work even
		in conditions when the SHELL environment variable is set

9/17/95		Enhanced top level makefile for Microsoft C 32 to build the
		system from scratch

9/24/95		Macro guarded multhead/include/kernel.h

		Fixed bug which allowed dpp to generate generics files with
		improper file extensions

		Changed dpp to generate generics files (both .c & .h) in a
		human readable format

		Changed the -mgt dpp option to -mg

		The -mg dpp option now also macro guards inline functions

		Added an option to cause dpp to always generate a generics.h
		file, even if it's the same.

9/25/95		Fixed code ordering problem in dpp which caused problems
		with generics.h files and inline generics

		Added compile date and time to dpp help display

		Fixed bug in new kernel code which killed the fast-wide cache
		option

		Added DPP_STRATEGY & DPP_FASTWIDE auto macros to dpp so Dynace
		now automatically sets and verifies the build mode for
		consistancy

		Fixed declaration problem with gInvalidObject when used with
		fast-wide cache

9/26/95		Fixed incorrect include sequence in a few class modules

		Fixed a number of C++ compiler warnings associated with the
		new GCC compiler

10/10/95	Enhanced top level m32.dm with more options

10/22/95	Added s32.dm files in support of Symantec C++
		(Doesn't work due to a bug in their compiler version 7.2)

		Added a quick and dirty port to the Macintosh (68k) using
		Code Warrior 6.1

10/26/95	Received a patch from Symantec and completed port
		(including Windows stuff)

1/14/96		Removed garbage multi-header makefiles
		
		Made change to DPP such that if you explicitly name a method
		DPP will generate code so that that name gets associated
		with the interface that matches the one defined in the .d file

1/26/96		Added defines in dpp for debugging method/generic interface

		Fixed bug in generic/method interface which caused bad code to
		be produced

1/27/96		Fixed misc bugs associated with explicitly naming methods

		Made changes necessary to allow Strategy 1 to work again
		(version 3.x assembler generics)

		Added MAKE_REST macro to make the _rest_ variable Strategy
		independent

		Made several adjustments to the array classes to make them
