The following gives a basic outline of the sub-directory structure associated
with the Dynace system.

Assuming you are at the root of the Dynace distribution you should have
the following sub-directories:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
bin		various executables associated with the system (such as the
		Dynace pre-processor (dpp), and utilities to simulate unix
		functionality under DOS/Windows such as make, cp, etc.)

include		various include files required by the whole system
