After Dynace was written, a Win32 GUI development set of Dynace
classes was constructed.  That set of classes was called the Windows
Development System (WDS).  Dynace, together with WDS, was used in
commercial applications for about 20 years.  So it was well tested and
valid for production use.

An open-source release was made of both.  WDS was also ported to the
Wine library so that GUI applications could easily be built for
Windows, Mac, or Linux using a single code-base.

However, over the years Win32 slowly morphed a bit, especially to
support the 64-bit environment.  Every few years we tested our Wine
port and found many changes were needed each time.

While WDS could simultaneously support native Win32 under 32 and 64 bit
Windows as well as WINE, this would require ongoing effort.  The 
problem is I do not have any sense that WDS is being used anymore.
It is, therefore, not worth the effort.

I have decided to remove WDS in order to have a simpler system
that works well without a lot of ongoing effort.  My plan is to put WDS
in it's own repo for those interested.  It will not be enhanced
anymore.

WDS is now its own project on GitHub.
