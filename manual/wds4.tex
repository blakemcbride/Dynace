@chapter Library Reference
@pdfchapter{Library Reference}

This chapter gives a detailed description of each WDS class.  It is
organized by facility so that in order to look something up, you would
first go to the section which deals with the facility you are interested
in.  And then the functions are in alphabetical order.

There is a naming convention used with Dynace generics.  All generics
start with either a lower case ``g'', ``v'' or ``m'', and are always
followed by an upper case letter.  The ones which start with ``g'' are
normal generics and may be treated like normal C functions.  The ones
which begin with ``v'' use the variable argument facilities of C and
you should, therefore, take a bit extra care when using them since
there is no compile time argument checking being done with these functions.

Since all generics start with either ``g'', ``v'' or ``m'' and in order to
avoid the difficulty associated with grouping all the generics under
three letters, the first letter is dropped for indexing or heading
purposes.  Therefore if you are looking up a generic, it will always
appear in the index or header with its first letter missing.  The syntax
description and example code, however, will show the entire name.

There is one thing about Dynace which you must be aware of, however.
Dynace generic functions (which is what most of these functions are)
allow the same function to be called in many circumstances.  These
generic functions dynamically dispatch to the appropriate procedures
based on the type of the first argument to the generic function (or
``generic'' for short).  So even though you are calling the same
function name, entirely different functionality may occur based on the
type of the first argument.  This fact is seldom, if ever, a problem
since you know whether you are dealing with an icon or a dialog, for
example, at any given point.  Just be sure to look up the generic in
the appropriate section.


@section A Note To Dynace Language Users
@pdfsection{A Note To Dynace Language Users}
In an effort to hide unnecessary details associated with class vs.
instance methods from WDS users who don't care about the differences,
these differences are not discussed or grouped as they are in the
Dynace manual.  You can always distinguish between the two by what
the method takes as its first argument.  If it's a class, then you
have a class method, otherwise it's an instance method.

If you are a WDS user with interest in the Dynace object oriented
extension to C, it is fully documented in its associated manual.




@section Class Hierarchy
@pdfsection{Class Hierarchy}
This Dynace Windows Development System contains the following class
hierarchy:

@c @example
@c @group
@iftex
@break

@input wdscls1.tex


@end iftex
@c @end group
@c @end example





@section Application
@pdfsection{Application}
The @code{Application} class is the class used to control application
wide defaults such as fonts, cursors, brushes and so on.  It is also
the class which gets executed by Windows first and executes your
application specific @code{start} function.

There are no instance methods associated with the @code{Application} class.
All access to this class is through class methods via the global class
object @code{Application}.














@pdfsubsection {CmdLine}
@deffn {CmdLine} CmdLine::Application
@sp 2
@example
@group
cl = gCmdLine(Application);

char    *cl;    /*  command line   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to gain access to command line which was used when
the application was launched.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

int     cl;

cl = gCmdLine(Application);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Instance, Show, PrevInstance}
@end deffn















@pdfsubsection {Error}
@deffn {Error} Error::Application
@sp 2
@example
@group
gError(obj, msg);

object  obj;    /*  any object     */
char    *msg;   /*  error message  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used in a severe error condition to issue an error message
to the user and terminate the application.  This method should be avoided
if possible.

Note that this method is actually associated with the Dynace @code{Object}
class which is why the first argument may be any Dynace object.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gError(Application, "Error message");
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{QuitApplication}
@end deffn

@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain a copy of the default background brush
object associated with the application.  The returned object will be an
instance of one of the subclasses of the @code{Brush} class.

The object returned must, either explicitly or implicitly, be
disposed when it is no longer needed.  This is normally done
automatically by WDS when it is associated with a window.

@deffn {Instance} Instance::Application
@sp 2
@example
@group
ins = gInstance(Application);

HINSTANCE  ins;    /*  instance handle   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to gain access to the Windows instance handle
associated with the application.  This handle is mainly used internally
by Windows and WDS, and should not normally be needed by a WDS
programmer.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

HINSTANCE  ins;    /*  instance handle   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to gain access to the Windows instance handle
associated with the previous instance of this application, should more
than one be running.  This handle is mainly used internally by Windows
and WDS, and should not normally be needed by a WDS programmer.

This value will always be @code{NULL} under Windows NT.
@example
@group

object  fnt;    /*  current font object  */
object  r;      /*  Application          */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to convert coordinates from pixels to the current
scaling mode.  It is mainly used internally by WDS in order to
convert Window's standard pixel positions into the current scaling mode.

On entry @code{x} and @code{y} point to values which are coordinates in
terms of pixels.  After this method returns, their value will be changed
to be in terms of the current scaling mode (see @code{SetScalingMode}).

@code{fnt} is a font object which is used only if the current scaling
mode is relative to a font.  If so, the font it will be related to
will be the one passed.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

int     y, x;
object  fnt;

y = some position;
x = some position;
fnt = some font object;
gScaleToCurrentMode(Application, &y, &x, fnt);

@end example
This method is used to convert coordinates from the current scaling mode
to pixels.  It is mainly used internally by WDS in order to convert
your coordinates into standard pixel positions.

On entry @code{x} and @code{y} point to values which are coordinates
in terms of the current scaling mode (see @code{SetScalingMode}).
After this method returns, their value will be changed to be in terms
of pixels.

@code{fnt} is a font object which is used only if the current scaling
mode is relative to a font.  If so, the font it will be related to
will be the one passed.

r = gSetBackBrush(Application, bo);

object  bo;     /*  brush object         */
object  r;      /*  brush object passed  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the application wide default background
brush.  This is the brush used to color everything except the text that
appears on windows and dialogs.  @code{bo} must be an instance of one of
the subclasses of @code{Brush}.  All windows and dialogs will use the
application wide default brush which is in effect when they are created
unless a specific brush object is specified for a particular window.

When a new default brush object is set, any previous default object
will be disposed.  If no default is set, WDS uses the system brush
identified as @code{COLOR_WINDOW}.

See the @code{Brush} class and its subclasses for further details.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gSetBackBrush(Application, vNew(SystemBrush, COLOR_WINDOW));

@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the application wide default cursor.
@code{co} must be an instance of one of the subclasses of @code{Cursor}.
All windows will use the application wide default cursor which is in
effect when they are created unless a specific cursor object is
specified for a particular window.

When a new default cursor object is set, any previous default object
will be disposed.  If no default is set, WDS uses the system cursor
identified as @code{IDC_ARROW}.

See the @code{Cursor} class and its subclasses for further details.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gSetCursor(Application, gLoadSys(SystemCursor, IDC_ARROW));
@end group

@pdfsubsection {SetFont}
@deffn {SetFont} SetFont::Application
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gSetFont(Application, fo);

object  fo;     /*  font object         */
object  r;      /*  font object passed  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the application wide default font.
@code{fo} must be an instance of one of the subclasses of @code{Font}.
All windows will use the application wide default font which is in
effect when they are created unless a specific font object is
specified for a particular window.

When a new default font object is set, any previous default object
will be disposed.  If no default is set, WDS uses the system font
identified as @code{SYSTEM_FONT}.

See the @code{Font} class and its subclasses for further details.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gSetFont(Application, vNew(SystemFont, SYSTEM_FONT));

@group
r = gSetIcon(Application, io);

object  io;     /*  icon object         */
object  r;      /*  icon object passed  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the application wide default icon.  An icon
associated to a window is the one which is displayed when the window is
iconized.  @code{io} must be an instance of one of the subclasses of
@code{Icon}.  All windows will use the application wide default icon
which is in effect when they are created unless a specific icon object
is specified for a particular window.

When a new default icon object is set, any previous default object
will be disposed.  If no default is set, WDS uses the system icon
identified as @code{IDI_APPLICATION}.

See the @code{Icon} class and its subclasses for further details.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gSetIcon(Application, gLoadSys(SystemIcon, IDI_APPLICATION));

@pdfsubsection {SetName}
@deffn {SetName} SetName::Application
@sp 2
@example
@group
gSetName(Application, nm);

char    *nm;    /*  application name  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to give the application a globally accessible name.
This name is accessible via @code{GetName}.  There is no other use
made of this information.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gSetName(Application, "My App");
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{GetName}
@end deffn















@pdfsubsection {SetScalingMode}
@deffn {SetScalingMode} SetScalingMode::Application
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gSetScalingMode(Application, m);

int     m;      /*  scaling mode   */
int     r;      /*  previous mode  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the scaling mode used by all other WDS methods
which take coordinate positions.  Valid modes are as follows:
@table @code
@item SM_1_PER_CHAR
This mode causes each position to be in increments determined by the
size of the current font.  For example row 7 would mean 7 times the
height of the current font.  Similar to line positions.
@item SM_10_PER_SYSCHAR
This mode causes each position to be in increments determined by one
tenth the size of the system font declared globally to the user's
Windows environment.  For example row 70 would mean 7 times the height
of the Windows global system font.  This allows positioning relative
to a scaling factor determined by the user.
@item SM_PIXELS
This mode performs no conversion.  The application is able to use
pixel coordinated directly.
@end table

The default value is @code{SM_1_PER_CHAR}.

The value returned is the mode which was previously set.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gSetScalingMode(Application, SM_PIXELS);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1

r = gSetTextBrush(Application, bo);

object  bo;     /*  brush object         */
object  r;      /*  brush object passed  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the application wide default text brush.
This is the brush used by all text output (or foreground) to windows or
dialogs.  @code{bo} must be an instance of one of the subclasses of
@code{Brush}.  All windows and dialogs will use the application wide
default brush which is in effect when they are created unless a specific
brush object is specified for a particular window.

When a new default brush object is set, any previous default object
will be disposed.  If no default is set, WDS uses the system brush
identified as @code{COLOR_WINDOWTEXT}.

See the @code{Brush} class and its subclasses for further details.
@example
@group

@deffn {Show} Show::Application
@sp 2
@example
@group
sv = gShow(Application);

int     sv;     /*  show value   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to gain access to the show value supplied by Windows
when an application starts.  It is normally used to determine how an
initial application's main window should be shown.  The available
options are Windows macros which begin with @code{SW_} and are fully
documented by the Windows documentation under the @code{WinMain}
function.
@example
@group

@section Windows
@pdfsection{Windows}
This section documents the @code{Window} class which contains all the
functionality which is common to Main, Child, and Popup windows.  See
chapter 2 of this manual for a description of the different window
types.



@pdfsubsection {Common Window Functions}



@pdfsubsubsection {AddHandlerAfter}
@deffn {AddHandlerAfter} AddHandlerAfter::Window
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gAddHandlerAfter(wind, msg, func);

object   wind;     /*  a window object  */
unsigned msg;      /*  message          */
long    (*func)(); /*  function pointer */
object  r;         /*  the window obj   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate function @code{func} with Windows window
message @code{msg} for window @code{wind}.  Whenever window @code{wind}
receives message @code{msg}, @code{func} will be called.

@code{wind} is the window object who's messages you wish to process.
@code{msg} is the particular message you wish to trap.  These messages
are fully documented in the Windows documentation in the Messages
section.  They normally begin with @code{WM_}.

@code{func} is the function which gets called whenever the specified
message gets received and takes the following form:
@example
@group
long    func(object     wind,
             HWND       hwnd, 
             UINT       mMsg, 
             WPARAM     wParam, 
             LPARAM     lParam)
@{
        .
        .
        .
        return 0L;  /* or whatever is appropriate  */
@}
@end group
@end example
Where @code{wind} is the window being sent the message.  The remaining
arguments and return value is fully documented in the Windows documentation
under the @code{WindowProc} function and the Windows Messages documentation.

WDS keeps a list of functions associated with each message associated
with each window.  When a particular message is received the appropriate
list of handler functions gets executed sequentially.
@code{AddHandlerAfter} appends the new function to the end of this list,
and @code{AddHandlerBefore} adds the new function to the beginning of
the list.

WDS may also, and optionally, execute the Windows default procedure
associated with a given message either before or after the user added
list of functions.  This behavior may be controlled via
@code{DefaultProcessingMode}.

Windows will only see the return value of the last message handler executed
including, if applicable, the default.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

int     hSize, vSize;

long    (*fun)();  /*  function         */
object   r;        /*  the menu         */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate an application specific function
(@code{fun}) with a menu item (@code{itm}) associated with the current
menu attached to window @code{wind}.  Once this is done, if the user selects
the menu option identified by @code{itm}, then the function @code{fun}
will be executed.

@code{itm} is a programmer defined macro which identifies one particular
choice among those available within the menu which is currently attached
to window @code{wind}.  This macro is defined while the programmer defines
the entire menu using the resource editor.

@code{fun} is the function which will be executed when the user selects
menu option @code{itm} and has the following form:
@example
@group
long    fun(object wind, unsigned id)
@{
        .
        .
        .
        return 0L;
@}
@end group
@end example
The function executed (@code{fun}) is passed the window object and
the specific menu id which the user selected and
returns a long.  The return value is documented in the Windows documentation
under the message named @code{WM_COMMAND}.  It should normally be @code{0L}.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

static  long    file_message(object wind)
@{
        gMessage(wind, "File_Message");
        return 0L;

int      mode;     /*  auto dispose mode  */
int      r;        /*  previous value     */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to enable or disable the auto dispose mechanism
associated with a window.  This feature, when enabled, causes WDS to
automatically dispose of the WDS object associated with a window
whenever the user closes the window (@code{wind}).  Normally, when
this feature is disabled, if the user closes a window, WDS removes
the window from the display, but the WDS object remains intact until
the program manually disposes of the window object (via @code{Dispose}).
This feature is most commonly used with asynchronous, popup windows.

Note that it is invalid to attempt to use a WDS object subsequent to it
being disposed, and each unneeded WDS object must be deleted.

@code{mode} is set to @code{1} to enable the feature and @code{0}
to disable it.  The value returned is the prior mode.

int      mode;     /*  auto show mode     */
int      r;        /*  previous value     */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to enable or disable the auto show mechanism
associated with a window.  This feature, when enabled, causes WDS to
automatically display (execute @code{Show}) on a window which is written
to.  This enables the programmer to create a window which will automatically
popup the first time the program displays text to it.

@code{mode} is set to @code{1} to enable the feature and @code{0}
to disable it.  The value returned is the prior mode.

@end group
@end example
This method is used to determine what brush object is used for the
background of window @code{wind} and performs the same function as the
@code{Use} method when used with a @code{Brush} object.  Any previously
associated brush object will be disposed.  This brush object will also
be automatically disposed when the window is disposed.

The window passed is returned.

int      mode;     /*  default processing mode  */
object   r;        /*  the window obj           */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to determine when or if the Windows default message
procedure is processed for a given message (@code{msg}) associated with
a particular window (@code{wind}).

WDS allows a programmer to specify an arbitrary number of functions
to be executed whenever a window receives a specific message (via
@code{AddHandlerAfter} and @code{AddHandlerBefore}).  Windows has
default procedures associated with many window messages.  At times
it is necessary to replace or augment this default functionality.
@code{DefaultProcessingMode} gives the programmer control over when and
if this default Windows functionality.  @code{mode} is used to specify
the desired mode.  The following table indicates the valid modes:

@table @code
@item 0
Do not execute the Windows default processing
@item 1
Execute default processing @emph{after} programmer defined handlers
@item 2
Execute default processing @emph{before} programmer defined handlers
@end table

Note that the default mode is always @code{1}, and must be explicitly
changed, if desired, for each message associated with each window.

@code{msg} is the particular message you wish to affect.  These messages
are fully documented in the Windows documentation in the Messages
section.  They normally begin with @code{WM_}.
@example
@group

gDefaultProcessingMode(wind, (unsigned) WM_SIZE, 0);

@end group
@end example
This method is used to remove and dispose of a window object when it
is no longer needed.  This method should be called on all windows
when they are no longer needed.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.

with window @code{wind}.  The cursor would then be displayed if the pointer
was positioned over the window.

@code{csr} is a Windows defined macro which identifies the cursor.  The
available options are defined in the Windows documentation under the
function named @code{LoadCursor} and normally begin with @code{IDC_}.  The
cursor object will be automatically destroyed whenever the window is
destroyed or if a new cursor is loaded.

The value returned is an object representing the cursor loaded, or
@code{NULL} if the cursor was not found.

This method is used to remove and destroy the current menu associated
with window @code{wind} and restore the previous menu associated with
the window.  A last-in-first-out list of menus associated with a window
may be established via the @code{LoadMenu}, @code{LoadMenuStr} or
@code{Use} methods.

All function associations and modes previously associated with the
new menu will be restored.

@end group
@end example
This method is used to display a string of text (@code{str}) in a sequential
fashion on window @code{wind}.  It is analogous to the standard C library
function @code{fprintf}.  All of the standard features of your C library
@code{fprintf} function are supported and that documentation should be
consulted for full documentation on the arguments.

This method is used to support the standard streams interface, is
actually defined by the @code{Stream} class, and is documented here for
convenience.

Note that this method begins with ``v'' since it takes variable arguments.
The length of the resulting output will be returned.
@example
@group

This method is used to display a string of text (@code{str}) in a sequential
fashion on window @code{wind}.  This method is used to support the standard
streams interface, is actually defined by the @code{Stream} class, and
is documented here for convenience.

@code{str} is the text to be displayed. Text @code{str} will be

unsigned len;   /*  length of buffer      */
int      r;     /*  bytes read            */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to read (accept) @code{len} key strokes from the user
and place them in @code{buf}.

Since the @code{Window} class is a subclass of @code{Stream}, this
method is mainly provided to support the standard interface dictated by
the @code{Stream} class.

This method returns the number of characters actually accepted.  It will
not be more than @code{len}, but may be less if non-blocking io is selected
(via @code{SetBlock}) and there aren't enough characters available.
@code{SetRaw} may also be used to control whether backspace processing will
be performed.

int     cols;   /*  columns to scroll   */
object  r;      /*  the window object   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to perform a horizontal scrolling of the text in
window @code{wind}.  This has the same effect as if the user caused
horizontal scrolling via the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom
of the window.  No text is lost, a different portion of the text is
displayed.

@code{wind} is the window which is to be affected, and @code{cols} is the
number of columns to scroll.  If @code{cols} is positive the scroll moves
the text to the left, and negative moves the text to the right.

The scaling factor associated with @code{cols} is set by
@code{SetScalingMode::Application}.
@example

This method is used to perform a vertical scrolling of the text in
window @code{wind}.  This has the same effect as if the user caused
vertical scrolling via the vertical scroll bar at the right side
of the window.  No text is lost, a different portion of the text is
displayed.

@code{wind} is the window which is to be affected, and @code{rows} is the
number of rows to scroll.  If @code{rows} is positive the scroll moves
the text up, and negative moves the text down.

The scaling factor associated with @code{rows} is set by
@code{SetScalingMode::Application}.

int     flag;   /*  enable/disable flag */
int     r;      /*  previous flag       */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the blocking mode associated with keyboard
IO.  It only has effect on @code{Read}, @code{Gets}, and @code{Getch}.
If flag is 1, blocking is enabled, and 0 disables blocking.  When a
new window is created it defaults to blocking enabled.

If blocking is turned on and a keyboard entry is requested (via
@code{Read}, @code{Gets} or @code{Getch}), the keyboard entry function
will not return until the request can be satisfied.  If, however,
blocking is disabled, a keyboard request is made, and insufficient
characters are available, then the input function will return immediately
with a return value indicating the result was short.

The value returned by this method is the previous blocking mode.
@example
@group

int     rows;   /*  max rows            */
int     r;      /*  previous max rows   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set or obtain the maximum number of lines of text
which may be associated to a window.  This includes all lines associated
with a window, including lines not being displayed because they are
scrolled off the screen.  Whenever @code{rows} number of lines are
exceeded, WDS automatically and permanently removes the lines at the
logical top of the internal buffer in order to make room for new
lines.

WDS keeps a buffer which holds a programmer definable number of lines of
text.  The user is then able to scroll through this text.  If the
application attempts to display more lines than this maximum (via
@code{vPrintf} for example) the system will automatically call
@code{gVertShift} in order to eliminate the top line and make room for
the new line being appended.

@code{wind} is the window which is to be affected, and @code{rows} is the
maximum number of rows to retain.  If @code{rows} is zero or negative,
the value associated with the window will not be changed.  This is used
to obtain the current value without changing it.

The value returned is the previous value associated with the window.
@example
@group

object  r;      /*  w arg passed        */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the name associated with window @code{wind}.
The name associated with a window is what is displayed at the top of the
window, if it has a title bar.  @code{name} may also be an @code{object}
typecast to a (@code{char *}).  The value returned is the window
(@code{wind}) object passed.

object  r;      /*  wind                  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create a child / parent window relationship.
This relationship is automatically established when a child window is
created.  However, this method is provided for increased flexibility.

Whenever the parent window is disposed, WDS will automatically dispose
of all its children windows.  This relationship should normally be
established prior to the child window being @code{Shown}.

The value returned is the child window passed.
@example
@group

object  r;      /*  wind arg passed     */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the initial position of a window.
@code{vert} and @code{horz} are in increments dictated by the
mode selected by @code{SetScalingMode::Application}.  The window
object passed is returned.

If this function is not called, Windows will automatically set it to a
reasonable default.
@example
@group

int     flag;   /*  enable/disable flag */
int     r;      /*  previous flag       */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the raw mode associated with keyboard
IO.  It only has effect on @code{Read}, @code{Gets}, and @code{Getch}.
If flag is 1, raw mode is enabled, and 0 disables raw mode.  The
default is raw mode disabled.

Normally, with raw mode disabled, when a user enters keyboard data,
they are able to correct mistakes by using the backspace and reentering
the correct data.  The resulting data the program receives is the
final, corrected input.

When raw mode is enabled, every key the user hits gets returned.  This
includes backspaces.  Therefore, with raw mode enabled, if the user types
``ABD'' followed by backspace and then ``C'', the program will receive all
five characters hit.  However, with raw mode disabled, the program would
only receive the resulting string, ``ABC''.

The value returned by this method is the previous raw mode.
@example
@group

@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the initial size of a window.
@code{vert} and @code{horz} are in increments dictated by the
mode selected by @code{SetScalingMode::Application}.  The window
object passed is returned.

If this function is not called, Windows will automatically set it to a
reasonable default.
@example

object  r;      /*  returns wind                */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the window style associated with window
@code{wind} to style @code{sty}.  The @code{DWORD} data type and valid 
styles are defined by Windows and fully documented by the Windows
documentation.  See the Windows documentation for the function called
@code{CreateWindow}.  The style types normally begin with @code{WS_}
and would be or'ed together to form the selected style.
Note that WDS automatically assigns reasonable defaults to a window
style when it is created.
@example
@group

object  tag;    /*  tag               */
object  r;      /*  previous tag      */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associated an arbitrary Dynace object with a
window object.  This may later be retrieved via the @code{GetTag} method.
Since WDS passes around the window object to all @code{Window} methods
this mechanism may be used to pass additional information with the
window.  And since Dynace treats all objects in a uniform manner, this
information attached to the window may be arbitrarily complex.

WDS does not dispose of the tag when the window object is disposed.
This method returns any previous object associated with the window or
@code{NULL}.
@example

char    *pt;    /*  previous help topic   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate help text with window @code{wind}.
The help text is defined using the Windows help system and labeled
with the topic indicated by @code{tpc}.  Then, if the user hits
the F1 key while in the window, WDS will automatically bring up
the Windows help system and find the indicated topic.

WDS also supports dialog and control specific topics.  See the appropriate
sections.

This method returns any previous topic associated with the window.
@example

This method is used to determine what brush object is used for foreground
text which is displayed.  Any previously associated brush object will
be disposed.  This brush object will also be automatically disposed when the
window is disposed.

The window passed is returned.

object  r;      /*  wind                     */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to display a string of text (@code{txt}) at row
@code{row} and column @code{col}.  @code{row} and @code{col} have their
origin in the upper left hand corner of the window and are scaled as
dictated by the @code{SetScalingMode::Application} method.
Their index origin is 0.

This method returns the window argument passed.

@end group
@end example
This method is used to explicitly update the display with changes the program
may have made to window @code{wind}.  WDS normally handles this need, however,
this method is available in case the programmer performs special processing
and wishes to update the entire window at one time.

This method returns the window argument passed.

object  wind;   /*  a window object     */
object  obj;    /*  arbitrary object    */
object  r;      /*  the object passed   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used as a general purpose mechanism to associated a
number of object types with a window.  @code{obj} may be a @code{Font,
Icon, Cursor, Menu,} or the background @code{Brush} object.  Those
objects would have normally been created via their associated classes
and then may be associated with a window via this method.

Note that the same object should not be associated with more than one
window.  The problem is that if one window is deleted, WDS would delete
all the objects associated with that window and then the other window
would reference objects which have been deleted.  The way around this is
to use the @code{Copy} method in order to make a copy of an object prior
to associating with a new window.  This way there would be two
independent objects such that if one is deleted the other would still
exist.

Note also that the @code{Application} class may be used to set application
wide defaults for these types of objects.

The value returned is the object passed.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  myWind, myOtherWind, someFont;

someFont = vNew(ExternalFont, "Times New Roman", 12);
if (someFont)  @{
        gUse(myWind, someFont);
        gUse(myOtherWind, gCopy(someFont));

object  wind;   /*  a window object     */
int     rows;   /*  rows to shift       */
object  r;      /*  the window object   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to perform a vertical shift of the text in the
memory buffer which is being displayed in the window.  WDS keeps
a buffer which holds a programmer definable number of lines of text.
The user is then able to scroll through this text.  If the application
attempts to display more lines than this maximum (via @code{vPrintf}
for example) the system will automatically call @code{gVertShift} in
order to eliminate the top line and make room for the new line being
appended.  This method is mainly used internally.

@code{wind} is the window which is to be affected, and @code{rows} is the
number of rows to scroll.  If @code{rows} is positive the scroll moves
the text up, and negative moves the text down.  Scrolling up permanently
destroys lines at the beginning of the buffer and scrolling down
permanently destroys lines at the end of the buffer.

The scaling factor associated with @code{rows} is set by
@code{SetScalingMode::Application} and the maximum lines associated with
a window may be set with @code{SetMaxLines}.
@example
@group

object  myWind;

gVertShift(myWind, 2);

unsigned len;   /*  length of string      */
int      r;     /*  bytes written         */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to display a string of text (@code{txt}) in a sequential
fashion on window @code{wind}.  Since the @code{Window} class is a subclass
of @code{Stream}, this method is mainly provided to support the standard
interface dictated by the @code{Stream} class.  By providing this method,
the @code{Window} class automatically inherits the @code{Puts} and
@code{Printf} capability.

@code{txt} is the text to be displayed and @code{len} is the length of that
string.  Text @code{txt} will be displayed on window @code{wind} and
@code{len} will be returned.

@group

@subsection Main Window
@pdfsubsection{Main Window}
This class, named @code{MainWindow}, is used to create and manipulate an
application's main window.  There is normally one main window associated
with each application and this is the first window created.

This class is a subclass of the @code{Window} class and therefore
inherits all of the @code{Window} class's functionality.  The methods
documented in this subsection are only those which are particular
to the @code{MainWindow} class.

@example
@group
r = vNew(MainWindow, ttl);

char    *ttl;   /*  window title  */

@end group
@end example
This class method is used to create the main application window.
Since this is a class method the first argument must be literally
@code{MainWindow}.  The window title (@code{ttl}) will appear at
the top of the window.

The value returned is the new window created.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  myWind;

myWind = vNew(MainWindow, "My Application");

@group
r = gProcessMessages(wind);

object  wind;   /*  a window object       */
int     r;      /*  final message result  */
@end group
@end example
Once the main application window is created (via @code{vNew}) and
its various attributes set, @code{gProcessMessages} is called in order
to actually create the Windows window, with the selected attributes,
display (show) it, and process the application's messages.  Processing
the application's messages is what allows the user to interact with the
application.

The value returned is the return value specified when the application is
terminated.  This can be specified via @code{QuitApplication::Application}.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  myWind;

myWind = vNew(MainWindow, "Application Name");
gProcessMessages(myWind);

@subsection Child Windows
@pdfsubsection{Child Windows}
The Child Window class, called @code{ChildWindow}, is used in the creation
of windows which are children of other windows.  As such, they can not
be positioned outside of their parent window, and they get iconized along
with their parent window.


This class is a subclass of the @code{Window} class and therefore
inherits all of the @code{Window} class's functionality.  The methods
documented in this subsection are only those which are particular
to the @code{ChildWindow} class.

int     cols;   /*  width of window       */
object  r;      /*  new window            */
@end group
@end example
This class method is used to create a child window.
Since this is a class method the first argument must be literally
@code{ChildWindow}.  @code{prnt} represents the parent window
object of which the new window will be a child.  @code{rows} and
@code{cols} determine the initial size of the window in are specified
in increments dictated by @code{SetScalingMode::Application}.

The default style associated with the child window is
@code{WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE} and may be changed with @code{SetStyle::Window}.
The position may be set with @hfil @break @code{SetPosition::Window}.

The value returned is the new window created.
@example

@subsection Popup Windows
@pdfsubsection{Popup Windows}
The @code{PopupWindow} class is used to create arbitrary windows which
function independently of other windows.  That is, they may overlap or
be moved outside of other windows and iconized independently of other
windows.  If, however, a popup window is associated with a parent window
(via @code{SetParent::Window}) then it may move outside the parent but
will be iconized with it.

This class is a subclass of the @code{Window} class and therefore
inherits all of the @code{Window} class's functionality.  The methods
documented in this subsection are only those which are particular
to the @code{PopupWindow} class.

@section Printing
@pdfsection{Printing}
The @code{Printer} class is used for all aspects of printing.
It is a subclass of the Dynace @code{Stream} class and as
such inherits all of its functionality.

All methods in the class use an argument referred to as @code{pntr}.
This will always be the printer object returned by @code{QueryPrinter},
@code{New} or @code{NewWithHDC} and used to identify the printer
which is to be effected.

The value returned by all methods which cause text or graphics output is
very significant.  During normal operation, the printer object passed
will be returned.  However, if an error occurs or the user aborted the
report a @code{NULL} will be returned.  In this case further output
should be avoided (although it won't hurt - it'll just be ignored) and
the printer object should be disposed.

All positioning parameters are in increments dictated by
@code{SetScale}.  Positions begin in the upper left hand corner and have
an index origin of 0.

This class method is used to create a new @code{Printer} object which
will be used by the @code{Printer} instance methods to control the
printer, fonts and content of output.

This method opens up the printer identified by @code{hdc}.  This is
a Windows internal identifier and may be obtained via the
@code{PrintDialog} class.

@code{pwind} is the window which will act as the parent to any
messages which may be displayed when a report is being printed.
@code{rname} determines what the report is referred to as in any
messages.

The value returned represents the printer to be used.  If the 
printer couldn't be opened, @code{NULL} will be returned.

This method is seldom needed due to @code{QueryPrinter} and @code{New}.
Use them. If an object is returned, it must be disposed (via
@code{Dispose}) when it is no longer needed.

This method is used to output a string of text (@code{str}) in a sequential
fashion on printer @code{pntr}.  It is analogous to the standard C library
function @code{fprintf}.  All of the standard features of your C library
@code{fprintf} function are supported and that documentation should be
consulted for full documentation on the arguments.

This method is used to support the standard streams interface, is
actually defined by the @code{Stream} class, and is documented here for
convenience.

Note that this method begins with ``v'' since it takes variable arguments.

The value returned by this method is very significant.  During normal
operation, the length of the output string will be returned.  However,
if an error occurs or the user aborted the report a @code{-1} will be
returned.  In this case further output should be avoided (although it
won't hurt - it'll just be ignored) and the printer object should be
disposed.

This method is used as a general purpose mechanism to associated a
number of object types with a printer.  @code{obj} may be a @code{Font,
Brush} or @code{Pen} object.  Those objects would have normally been
created via their associated classes and then may be associated with a
printer via this method.

Note that the same object should not be associated with more than one
printer object.  The problem is that if one printer object is disposed, WDS
would dispose of all the objects associated with that printer and then the
other printer would reference objects which have been deleted.  The way
around this is to use the @code{Copy} method in order to make a copy of
an object prior to associating it with a new printer.  This way there would
be two independent objects such that if one is deleted the other would
still exist.

The value returned is the object passed.

@section Menus
@pdfsection{Menus}
The @code{Menu} class, although not used directly by an application, is
used to house the common functionality associated with the
@code{ExternalMenu} and @code{InternalMenu} classes.  Most of the
functionality of those classes is implemented and documented in this
section.

External menus (those defined in resources) would be created and used
via the @code{ExternalMenu} class.  Internal menus (those defined at runtime
by the application code) would be created and used via the
@code{InternalMenu} and @code{PopupMenu} classes.  Since both of these
classes are subclasses of the @code{Menu} class, they inherit most of
their functionality from it.

long    (*fun)(object);  /*  function to execute  */
object  r;      /*  the menu object   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate a function with a menu item such that if
the user selects the menu item, @code{fun} gets executed.

In the case of external menus, @code{id} is normally a macro created by
the resource editor while the programmer defines the menu and identifies
a particular menu option.

@code{fun} is the application specific function which automatically gets
executed whenever the user selects the indicated option.  @code{fun} has
the following structure:
@example
@group
static  long    menu_option(object wind)
{
           .
           .
           .
        return 0L;
}
@end group
@end example
Where @code{wind} is the window object which the menu is attached to.
The value returned is what is returned by the window procedure associated
with the window.  This value is normally 0 and is fully documented by
the Windows documentation under the @code{WM_COMMAND} message.

The value returned is the menu object passed.

This method is used to dispose of a menu object and all menu objects
which were pushed (via @code{Push}) into the same menu stack.  It is not
often needed because menus associated with a window are automatically
disposed of (via this method) when the window is disposed.

If @code{menu} is an internal menu, all associated popup menus will
also be disposed.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.

This method is used to set the mode associated with a menu item.  This
mode specifies whether the menu is enabled, disabled or grayed.

In the case of external menus, @code{id} is normally a macro created by
the resource editor while the programmer defines the menu and identifies
a particular menu option.  In the case of internal menu's, @code{id}
is the number returned by @code{AddMenuOption::InternalMenu} or
@code{AddMenuOption::PopupMenu}.

@code{mode} is a Windows defined macro and may be one of the following:
@example
@group
MF_ENABLED      to enable the menu item
MF_DISABLED     to disable the menu item
MF_GRAYED       to gray the menu option

int     id;     /*  item id  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to append a new option to internal menu object
@code{mnu} and associate it to an application specific function
(@code{fun}).  Once this is done, if the user selects the new menu
option the function @code{fun} will be executed.

@code{ttl} represents the character string which will be displayed
in the menu.  @code{ttl} may also contain an embedded ampersand (&)
character.  This causes the character following the ampersand to
be underlined.  It also causes the following character to be the
Alt key selection the user can use to quickly select a menu option.

@code{fun} is the function which will be executed when the user selects
the menu option and has the following form:
@example

@end group
@end example
The function executed (@code{fun}) is passed the window object and
returns a long.  The return value is documented in the Windows documentation
under the message named @code{WM_COMMAND}.  It should normally be @code{0L}.

This method returns a unique WDS generated id which identifies this
particular menu option and may be used to control the status of the option.
@example
@group

object  pm;     /*  Popup menu  */
object  r;      /*  menu        */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to append a new option to menu object @code{mnu} and
associate it to a popup menu.  Once this is done, if the user selects
the new menu option the popup menu will be displayed.

@code{ttl} represents the character string which will be displayed
in the menu.  @code{ttl} may also contain an embedded ampersand (&)
character.  This causes the character following the ampersand to
be underlined.  It also causes the following character to be the
Alt key selection the user can use to quickly select a menu option.

@code{pm} is a popup menu object created with the @code{PopupMenu}
class.

This method returns @code{mnu}.
@example
@group

This method is used to create a new internal menu.  An internal menu is
one which is not pre-specified with the resource editor.  It may therefore
be structured at runtime.

The object returned is a new internal menu object with no items associated
with it.

@end group
@end example
This method is used to dispose of a menu object when it is no longer
needed.  It is not often needed because popup menus associated with
other menus are automatically disposed of (via @code{DeepDispose}) when
the top level menu is disposed.

This class also provides a @code{DeepDispose} which performs the same
function.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.
@example

This method is used to create a new popup menu.  A popup menu is one
which pops up or appears when a user selects an associated menu option.
Popup menus are used in conjunction with internal menus in order to
create arbitrarily complex menu structures.

@code{tm} is the top menu object.  It must be an @code{InternalMenu},
regardless of where the new popup menu will be nested.

The object returned represents the new popup menu created and may be
used to add items to that menu.

@section Dialogs
@pdfsection{Dialogs}
The @code{Dialog} class implements all the functionality which is common
to the @code{ModalDialog} and @code{ModelessDialog} classes, and although
this class is not used directly, most of their functionality is documented
in this section.

@subsection  Standard Dialog Method Arguments
@pdfsubsection{Standard Dialog Method Arguments}

Since all dialog instance methods have the dialog object as the first
argument (referred to as @code{dlg}), this argument will not be described
each time.  It always refers to the dialog object which you wish to
perform the desired operation on.

Many of the methods associated with this class take an argument
identified as @code{id}.  This is a macro defined by the programmer via
the resource editor when the dialog is being defined and is used to
uniquely identify a particular control within the dialog.  Due to the
fact that this argument has the same meaning for every method which
uses it, it will not be defined each time.

The variable @code{ctl} will always refer to a control object.  Each
control object represents a unique control within a dialog.  Each
control object will be an instance of one of the subclasses of the
@code{Control} class (such as @code{TextControl} or
@code{NumericControl}).



@subsection Dialog Methods
@pdfsubsection{Dialog Methods}






@pdfsubsubsection {AddControl}
@deffn {AddControl} AddControl::Dialog
@sp 2
@example
@group
ctl = mAddControl(dlg, ctlClass, id);

object  dlg;       /*  a dialog object   */
object  ctlClass;  /*  class of control  */
unsigned  id;      /*  control id        */
object  ctl;       /*  control object    */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create a new control object and associate it to
a control defined in the dialog.  @code{ctlClass} must be literally
one of the subclasses of the @code{Control} class (such as
@code{TextControl}, @code{CheckBox}, @code{RadioButton}, etc).
See the class hierarchy for a complete list.

@code{id} identifies which control within dialog @code{dlg} to associate
the new control object with.

The value returned (@code{ctl}) is the new control object created and
will be an instance of the class indicated by the @code{ctlClass}
argument.  This object can be configured and queried via the protocol
defined by its class.  See that section for available options.  Setting
various options associated with this object will control default values
associated with the control and how this control functions within the
dialog.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  dlg, ctl;

ctl = mAddControl(dlg, TextControl, PERSONS_NAME);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1

@pdfsubsubsection {AddDlgHandlerAfter}
@deffn {AddDlgHandlerAfter} AddDlgHandlerAfter::Dialog
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gAddDlgHandlerAfter(dlg, msg, func);

object   dlg;      /*  a dialog object  */
unsigned msg;      /*  message          */
BOOL    (*func)(); /*  function pointer */
object  r;         /*  the dialog obj   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate function @code{func} with Windows dialog
message @code{msg} for dialog @code{dlg}.  Whenever dialog @code{dlg}
receives message @code{msg}, @code{func} will be called.

@code{dlg} is the dialog object who's messages you wish to process.
@code{msg} is the particular message you wish to trap.  These messages
are fully documented in the Windows documentation in the Messages
section.  They normally begin with @code{WM_}.

@code{func} is the function which gets called whenever the specified
message gets received and takes the following form:
@example
@group
BOOL    func(object     dlg,
             HWND       hdlg, 
             UINT       mMsg, 
             WPARAM     wParam, 
             LPARAM     lParam)
@{
        .
        .
        .
        return FALSE;  /* or whatever is appropriate  */
@}
@end group
@end example
Where @code{dlg} is the dialog being sent the message.  The remaining
arguments and return value is fully documented in the Windows documentation
under the @code{DialogProc} function and the Windows Messages documentation.

WDS keeps a list of functions associated with each message associated
with each dialog.  When a particular message is received the appropriate
list of handler functions gets executed sequentially.
@code{AddDlgHandlerAfter} appends the new function to the end of this list,
and @code{AddDlgHandlerBefore} adds the new function to the beginning of
the list.

Windows will only see the return value of the last message handler executed.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

int     hSize, vSize;

static  BOOL    process_wm_size(object  dlg, 
                                HWND    hwnd,

int     flg;    /*  desired mode       */
int     pflg;   /*  previous mode set  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to control the auto disposal facility associated with
a given dialog.  The default is disabled for modal dialogs and enabled
for modeless dialogs.

If enabled, the auto dispose feature will cause the dialog object
(@code{dlg}) to be automatically disposed of whenever the user accepts
or aborts the dialog.  If disabled, the application may continue to use
the object (for querying control values for example) after the dialog
has been terminated.  If the auto dispose feature is disabled the
application must explicitly dispose of the object when it is no longer
needed.

Note that if the auto dispose feature is used, the @code{gCompletionFunction}
method may be used to access the control values immediately prior to
the object's automatic disposal.

Set @code{flg} to 1 to enable the feature and 0 to disable it.  The
previous state will be returned.
@example
@group

object  brsh;   /*  brush object      */
object  r;      /*  dlg               */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the brush object which is used for the
background of the dialog.  Any previously associated brush object will
be disposed.  This brush object will also be automatically disposed when
the dialog is disposed.

The dialog passed is returned.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  dlg;

gBackBrush(dlg, vNew(SolidBrush, 0, 255, 0));

int     (*fun)();  /*  completion function  */
object  r;         /*  dialog object        */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associated a C function with a dialog such that
when the user accepts or aborts the dialog, function @code{fun} will
get executed by WDS.  The function will get executed prior to any automatic
disposal of the dialog object.

The completion function facility is best used in conjunction with
modeless dialogs and the auto dispose facility in order to process
control values when the user accepts the dialog and prior to the
automatic disposal of the dialog object.

The format of @code{fun} is as follows:
@example
@group
r = fun(dlg, res);

object  dlg;    /*  the dialog object  */
int     res;    /*  result status of the dialog  */
int     r;      /*  result for gPerform  */
@end group
@end example
Where @code{res} will be @code{TRUE} if the user accepted the dialog or
@code{FALSE} if the user canceled the dialog.  @code{r} is the value
which will become the result of the dialog which is returned by @code{gPerform}
(if it was a modal dialog).  @code{r} will normally be @code{res}.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

static  int     fun(object dlg, int res)
@{
        .
        .
        return res;

@end group
@end example
This method is used to gain access to the value associated with a
particular control as a C double.  For example, if the control
was a numeric control and the user entered ``3.141'', then this method
would return a double ``3.141''.

@end group
@end example
This method is used to gain access to the value associated with a
particular control as a C long.  For example, if the control
was a numeric control and the user entered ``6'', then this method
would return a long ``6''.

In the case of date controls, the value returned will be in the
form YYYYMMDD.  For example November 24, 1956 would be
19561124.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  dlg;
long    val;

val = mCtlLongValue(dlg, PERSONS_AGE);

object  dlg;    /*  a dialog object  */
unsigned id;    /*  control id       */
short   val;    /*  control value    */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to gain access to the value associated with a
particular control as a C short.  For example, if the control
was a numeric control and the user entered ``6'', then this method
would return a short ``6''.

In the case of a list box or combo box the value returned will be in
terms of an ordinal value. This value returned is a zero based index
from top to bottom indicating the selection made by the user.  If no
selection was made negative value will be returned.  

In the case of check boxes and radio buttons this method will return
0 if the button is not selected, 1 if the button is selected, and
2 if the button is grayed.

In the case of scroll bars, this method will return a short value
between the minimum and maximum set for the control which indicates
where the control was set to.

@code{mCtlLongValue} should be used for date controls.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  dlg;

object  dlg;    /*  a dialog object  */
unsigned id;    /*  control id       */
char    *val;   /*  control value    */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to gain access to the value associated with a
particular control as a C character string.  For example, if the control
was a text control and the user entered ``Miami'', then this method
would return a pointer to the C string ``Miami''.

If the control being accessed is a list box or combo box, the value
returned will be a string representation of the text associated with the
choice made by the user.  See @code{CtlShortValue} or @code{IndexValue}
to get an ordinal value for this control type.

The character pointer returned will not be valid once the dialog or
control has been disposed.  Therefore, the value should be kept by
some other means if it is desired past the life of the dialog.

@group
@exdent Example:

object  dlg;
char    *val;

@end example
This method is used to gain access to the value associated with a
particular control as a C unsigned short.  For example, if the control

object  val;    /*  control value    */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to gain access to the value associated with a
particular control as a Dynace object.  For example, if the control
was a text control and user entered ``Miami'', then this method
would return a Dynace string object (not a normal C string) which
represents the value typed in.  This returned value may be used
and accessed like any other Dynace object using the appropriate
interface mechanism.

If the control being accessed is a list box or combo box, the value
returned will be a representation of the text associated with the choice
made by the user.  See @code{IndexValue} or @code{CtlShortValue} to get
a numeric representation for this control type.

The object returned will be automatically disposed when the dialog is
disposed, therefore, a copy (via @code{gCopy}) should be made of it if
its existence is required subsequent to the dialog's disposal.

WDS also provides several methods to obtain normal C data types directly.

This method is used to remove and dispose of a dialog object when it
is no longer needed.  This method should be called on all dialogs
when they are no longer needed.  In addition to disposing of the dialog,
this method will also dispose of all the control objects associated
with the dialog.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.

This method is used to obtain the Windows internal handle associated with
a dialog object.  It will only return a valid handle while the dialog
is being performed via @code{gPerform}.  @code{NULL} will be returned
otherwise.

Note that this method may be used with most WDS objects in order to obtain
the internal handle that Windows normally associates with each type of object.

object  dlg;    /*  a dialog object  */
unsigned id;    /*  control id       */
object  val;    /*  control value    */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to gain access to a Dynace object (as opposed to a
normal C integer) representing the value associated with a list box or
combo box in terms of an ordinal value. This value returned is a zero
based index from top to bottom indicating the selection made by the
user.  If no selection was made the object will represent a negative
value.  This returned value may be used and accessed like any other
Dynace object using the appropriate interface mechanisms.

The object returned will be automatically disposed when the dialog is
disposed, therefore, a copy (via @code{gCopy}) should be made of it if
its existence is required subsequent to the dialog's disposal.

WDS also provides several methods to obtain normal C data types directly.

This method is used to open up a temporary informational window.  The
window will contain the message given by @code{msg} and the user must
acknowledge the window prior to continuing by hitting an OK button.

This method may only be used either while the dialog is being performed
or at any time if it has an associated parent window.

@end example
This method is used to open up a temporary informational dialog.  The
dialog will contain the message given by @code{msg} and the user must
acknowledge the dialog prior to continuing by hitting an OK button.

If the user hits the @code{F1} key while presented with the message,
the help topic identified by @code{tpc} will get displayed via the Windows
help system.

This method may only be used either while the dialog is being performed
or at any time if it has an associated parent window.

The value returned is the dialog passed.

@group
@exdent Example:

object  dlg;

object  dlg;    /*  a dialog object  */
int     r;      /*  result           */
@end group
@end example
Once a dialog is created and fully specified, this method is used to
actually display the dialog and allow the user to interact with it.
The dialog will remain active until the user pushes the push buttons
with the label @code{IDOK} or @code{IDCANCEL}.

What occurs after calling @code{gPerform} depends on whether the dialog
was a modal or modeless dialog.

Control initial values should be set prior to calling @code{gPerform}.

MODAL DIALOGS

If the dialog being performed is a modal, then once @code{gPerform} is
evoked the user will be able to interact with the dialog and @code{gPerform}
will not return until the user either accepts or aborts the entire dialog.
This, in effect, will prevent the user from switching to any other window
or dialog within the application until the dialog is completed.

Finally, the value returned by @code{gPerform} will be the Windows
constant @code{FALSE} if the user canceled the dialog, the Windows
constant @code{TRUE} if the user accepted the dialog, or the
value returned by any completion function which was attached to the
dialog (via @code{CompletionFunction}).

Once @code{gPerform} returns, the dialog object may be queried in
order to obtain the final values associated with each control.

Unless the auto dispose feature is manually set for a modal dialog,
the dialog object is not automatically disposed and must be when
no longer needed.

MODELESS DIALOGS

Modeless dialogs operate different from modal dialogs.  When
@code{gPerform} is evoked on a modeless dialog, @code{gPerform} returns
immediately with a 0 value.  At that point the user is presented with the
dialog and allowed to edit it.  During that time your program would typically
return to the menu and wait for further user selections.  The user may
continue with the current dialog, abort it, or switch to another window
within the application with the ability to return at any point.  All the
user interaction is automatically handled by Windows and WDS.

Since the application code has gone on about its business after a call
to @code{gPerform} two things are left to be completed whenever the user
finally accepts or aborts the dialog.  First, the application will
typically want to do something with the data the user has entered on the
dialog.  And second, the dialog object will need to be disposed when
it's no longer needed.

When using modeless dialogs the programmer normally attaches a completion
function to the dialog via @code{gCompletionFunction}.  What this does
is cause the completion function to be executed whenever the user
accepts or aborts the dialog.  This application specific function can be
used to perform the final processing of the dialog's data.  See
@code{gCompletionFunction} for complete details.

By default, the auto dispose flag associated with modeless dialogs is
normally enabled.  This causes WDS to automatically dispose of a dialog
object and all associated controls immediately subsequent to executing
the completion function.  This way everything is cleaned up automatically.
This feature may be disabled via @code{gAutoDispose}, in which case the
application must be sure to dispose of the unneeded object.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  dlg;
int     r;

r = gPerform(dlg);

object  obj;    /*  result object    */
object  r;      /*  dlg              */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associated a Dynace short integer object with a
dialog such that when the dialog is completed or canceled by the user,
the associated object will be set to the dialog's result value.  This
feature is most often needed in conjunction with modeless dialogs and
the auto dispose feature.  It can be used to find out what happened to a
dialog subsequent to the dialog object being disposed.

The object associated with the dialog will never be disposed by WDS
and must be manually disposed when it is no longer needed.

@group
@exdent Example:

object  dlg, obj;

gSetResult(dlg, obj = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, -1));

object  tag;    /*  tag               */
object  r;      /*  previous tag      */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associated an arbitrary Dynace object with a
dialog object.  This may later be retrieved via the @code{GetTag} method.
Since WDS passes around the dialog object to all @code{Dialog} methods
this mechanism may be used to pass additional information with the
dialog.  And since Dynace treats all objects in a uniform manner, this
information attached to the dialog may be arbitrarily complex.

WDS does not dispose of the tag when the dialog object is disposed.
This method returns any previous object associated with the dialog or
@code{NULL}.

char    *pt;    /*  previous help topic   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate help text with dialog @code{dlg}.
The help text is defined using the Windows help system and labeled
with the topic indicated by @code{tpc}.  Then, if the user hits
the F1 key while in the dialog, WDS will automatically bring up
the Windows help system and find the indicated topic.

WDS also supports window and control specific topics.  See the appropriate
sections.

This method returns any previous topic associated with the dialog.

@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the brush object which is used for foreground
text which is displayed.  Any previously associated brush object will
be disposed.  This brush object will also be automatically disposed when the
dialog is disposed.

@section Controls
@pdfsection{Controls}
The @code{Control} class is never used directly.  It is used to group
functionality common to all the control types which are all subclasses
of this class.  Therefore, this section documents all the methods which
are accessible to all subclasses of this class.


Control instances are normally created via @code{AddControl::Dialog}
and may be subsequently accessed via @code{GetControl::Dialog}.



@subsection  Standard Control Method Arguments
@pdfsubsection{Standard Control Method Arguments}

Since all control instance methods have the control object as their
first argument (referred to as @code{ctl}), this argument will not be
described each time.  It always refers to the control object which you
wish to perform the desired operation on.  Each control object will be
an instance of one of the subclasses of the @code{Control} class (such
as @code{TextControl} or @code{NumericControl}).


Many of the methods associated with this class take an argument
identified as @code{id}.  This is a macro defined by the programmer via
the resource editor when the dialog is being defined and is used to
uniquely identify a particular control within the dialog.  Due to the
fact that this argument has the same meaning for every method which
uses it, it will not be defined each time.


@subsection Control Methods
@pdfsubsection{Control Methods}












@pdfsubsubsection {AddHandlerAfter}
@deffn {AddHandlerAfter} AddHandlerAfter::Control
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gAddHandlerAfter(ctl, msg, func);

object   ctl;      /*  a control object  */
unsigned msg;      /*  message           */
long    (*func)(); /*  function pointer  */
object  r;         /*  the control obj   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate function @code{func} with Windows control
message @code{msg} for control @code{ctl}.  Whenever control @code{ctl}
receives message @code{msg}, @code{func} will be called.

@code{ctl} is the control object who's messages you wish to process.
@code{msg} is the particular message you wish to trap.  These messages
are fully documented in the Windows documentation in the Messages
section.  They normally begin with @code{WM_}.

@code{func} is the function which gets called whenever the specified
message gets received and takes the following form:
@example
@group
long    func(object     ctl,
             HWND       hwnd, 
             UINT       mMsg, 
             WPARAM     wParam, 
             LPARAM     lParam)
@{
        .
        .
        .
        return 0L;  /* or whatever is appropriate  */
@}
@end group
@end example
Where @code{ctl} is the control being sent the message.  The remaining
arguments and return value is fully documented in the Windows documentation
under the @code{WindowProc} function and the Windows Messages documentation.

WDS keeps a list of functions associated with each message associated
with each control.  When a particular message is received the appropriate
list of handler functions gets executed sequentially.
@code{AddHandlerAfter} appends the new function to the end of this list,
and @code{AddHandlerBefore} adds the new function to the beginning of
the list.

WDS may also, and optionally, execute the Windows default procedure
associated with a given message either before or after the user added
list of functions.  This behavior may be controlled via
@code{DefaultProcessingMode}.

Windows will only see the return value of the last message handler executed
including, if applicable, the default.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

int     hSize, vSize;

This method is used to explicitly call the default Windows message handler
associated with message @code{msg}.  This method is normally called from
within a programmer defined message handler (see @code{AddHandlerAfter})
which is provided with the @code{wp} and @code{lp} parameters.  These
parameters are fully documented in the Windows Messages documentation
and relate directly to the particular message.

@code{msg} is the particular message you wish to affect.  These messages
are fully documented in the Windows documentation in the Messages
section.  They normally begin with @code{WM_}.

int     (*fun)(); /*  check function  */
object  r;        /*  ctl object      */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate an auxiliary checking function to a control.
When a dialog is accepted, WDS goes through each control to assure the
validity of the data associated with each control as defined by the control
object.  The ability to associated an additional function for validating
the data associated with a control gives the programmer the ability to perform
any additional application specific checking against a control's data.

The auxiliary checking function takes the following form:
@example
@group
int     fun(object ctl, object val, char *buf)
@{
        ....
@}
@end group
@end example
Where @code{ctl} is the control object, and @code{val} is a Dynace object which
represents the value the control has associated with it.  @code{buf} is a
pointer to a buffer area which @code{fun} must set to an appropriate error
message if an error occurs.  @code{fun} returns a 1 if an error occurs and
0 otherwise.

All controls support this feature except the @code{PushButton} class,
because it is an immediate action control with no associated value.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  ctl;

gCheckFunction(ctl, fun);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1

@group
r = gCheckValue(ctl)

object   ctl;   /*  a control object  */
int      r;     /*  result of call    */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to explicitly cause all error checking functions and
parameters associated with control @code{ctl} to be checked.  If an error
is encountered an appropriate error message will be displayed and a 1
will be returned.  If no error is encountered a 0 is returned.

This method is implemented by all subclasses of @code{Control} and mainly
used internally when the dialog is accepted.

int      mode;  /*  default processing mode  */
object   r;     /*  the control obj          */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to determine when or if the Windows default message
procedure is processed for a given message (@code{msg}) associated with
a particular control (@code{ctl}).

WDS allows a programmer to specify an arbitrary number of functions
to be executed whenever a control receives a specific message (via
@code{AddHandlerAfter} and @code{AddHandlerBefore}).  Windows has
default procedures associated with many control messages.  At times
it is necessary to replace or augment this default functionality.
@code{DefaultProcessingMode} gives the programmer control over when and
if this default Windows functionality.  @code{mode} is used to specify
the desired mode.  The following table indicates the valid modes:

@table @code
@item 0
Do not execute the Windows default processing
@item 1
Execute default processing @emph{after} programmer defined handlers
@item 2
Execute default processing @emph{before} programmer defined handlers
@end table

Note that the default mode is always @code{1}, and must be explicitly
changed, if desired, for each message associated with each control.

@code{msg} is the particular message you wish to affect.  These messages
are fully documented in the Windows documentation in the Messages
section.  They normally begin with @code{WM_}.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gDefaultProcessingMode(ctl, (unsigned) WM_SIZE, 0);

@group
r = gDispose(ctl);

object  ctl;   /*  a control object  */
object  r;     /*  NULL              */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to remove and dispose of a control object when it
is no longer needed.  This method is rarely needed due to the fact that
when a dialog is disposed it automatically calls this method on each of
its associated controls.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.
@example

ctl = gDispose(ctl);

@sp 2
@example
@group
h = gHandle(ctl);

object  ctl;    /*  control object   */
HANDLE  h;      /*  Windows handle  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain the Windows internal handle associated with
a control object.  It will only return a valid handle while the dialog
is being performed via @code{gPerform}.  @code{NULL} will be returned
otherwise.

Note that this method may be used with most WDS objects in order to obtain
the internal handle that Windows normally associates with each type of object.
See the appropriate documentation.
@example
@group

char    *tpc;   /*  help topic            */
char    *pt;    /*  previous help topic   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate help text with specific control @code{ctl}.
The help text is defined using the Windows help system and labeled
with the topic indicated by @code{tpc}.  Then, if the user hits
the F1 key while in the control, WDS will automatically bring up
the Windows help system and find the indicated topic.  If no control
specific help is specified, WDS will use any help associated with the
dialog as a whole.

WDS also supports dialog and control specific topics.  See the appropriate
sections.

This method returns any previous topic associated with the control.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  ctl;

gSetTopic(ctl, "myControlHelp");

object  r;     /*  control object  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate an independent Dynace object with the
value associated with a control object.  @code{val} should be an
instance of the @code{String} class and will be automatically updated
to reflect the value associated with the control.

This object (@code{val}) will never be disposed by WDS, even after
the control or associated dialog are disposed.  Therefore, this
is one way of gaining access to a control's value after the life
of the control.  It is the programmer's responsibility to dispose of
the object when it is no longer needed.

@subsection Date Control
@pdfsubsection{Date Control}
The @code{DateControl} class is a control which enables the user to
enter date information.  The user enters dates in the form mm/dd/yy
or mm/dd/yyyy, and when the user leaves the field it changes to the
form MMM DD, YYYY.  For example, the user would enter 6/8/59 and
when the field is accepted it will be changed to display Jun 8, 1959.

Dates are stored internally as C longs in the form YYYYMMDD so that
6/8/59 would be represented as the long 19590608.  This control has
numerous facilities to control the range and type of input the user is
allowed to enter.

The @code{DateControl} class is a subclass of @code{Control} and as such
inherits all the functionality associated with that class.  This section
only documents functionality particular to this class.

Standard control arguments are documented in the section entitled
``Standard Control Method Arguments''.












@pdfsubsubsection {Attach}

@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gAttach(ctl, val);

object  ctl;   /*  control object  */
object  val;   /*  ctl value       */
object  r;     /*  control object  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate an independent Dynace object with the
value associated with a control object.  @code{val} should be an
instance of the @code{Date} class.  This date object will be
automatically updated to reflect the value associated with the control.

This object (@code{val}) will never be disposed by WDS, even after
the control or associated dialog are disposed.  Therefore, this
is one way of gaining access to a control's value after the life
of the control.  It is the programmer's responsibility to dispose of
the object when it is no longer needed.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  ctl, val;

val = vNew(Date, 0L);

long    max;   /*  maximum value   */
int     an;    /*  allow none      */
object  r;     /*  control object  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the minimum and maximum allowable values
the control will accept from the user.  It also controls whether
or not the control will accept no date.

@code{min} and @code{max} are of the form YYYYMMDD.  For example
6/8/59 would be represented as 19590608.  If @code{an} is 0
the user must enter a valid date between @code{min} and @code{max}.
If, however, @code{an} is 1, the user must either enter a valid
date between the given ranges or may also leave the field blank.
If the user does not enter a date the field value will be 0L.

If the user enters an invalid date or one outside the specified range,
WDS will issue an error message and prompt the user for an acceptable
value.

object  ctl;

gDateRange(ctl, 19990101L, 19991231L, 1);

@subsection Push Buttons
@pdfsubsection{Push Buttons}
The @code{PushButton} class represents a control which allows the user
to perform an immediate action.  That means that there is no particular
data associated with the control.  The user pushes the button and an
associated action gets performed at that point.  The @code{PushButton}
class allows the programmer to associate a C function to the control
such that whenever the user clicks on the button the specified function
will be evoked.

The @code{PushButton} class is a subclass of @code{Control} and as such
inherits all the functionality associated with that class.  This section
only documents functionality particular to this class.

Standard control arguments are documented in the section entitled
``Standard Control Method Arguments''.

This method is used to create a new control object to be identified as

@end group
@end example
This method is used to manually evoke the function a programmer associated 
with a push button.  The value returned is the result of the function
attached to the button.

This method is seldom needed because WDS automatically evokes the function
when the user clicks the button.
@example
@group

object  ctl;

gPerform(ctl);

int     (*fun)(); /*  check function           */
ofun    r;        /*  previous check function  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate a C function to a push button such that
if the user clicks the button the C function will immediately get
evoked.  The value returned is the previous function, if any, associated
with the control.

The C function takes the following form:
@example
@group
int     fun(object ctl, object dlg)
@{
        ....
@}
@end group
@end example
Where @code{ctl} is the control object, and @code{dlg} is the object
representing the dialog the control is associated with.  The value
returned by @code{fun} only has meaning if the button was either
@code{IDOK} or @code{IDCANCEL} (the ones normally used to exit the
dialog).  If the return value is 1 then the dialog will exit like normal.
If the return value is 0 then the dialog will not exit.

@subsection Check Boxes
@pdfsubsection{Check Boxes}
The @code{CheckBox} class represents a control which allows the user
to select or de-select a particular option.  Unlike radio buttons,
check boxes are not mutually exclusive.

The @code{CheckBox} class is a subclass of @code{Control} and as such

@subsection Radio Buttons
@pdfsubsection{Radio Buttons}
The @code{RadioButton} class represents a control which allows the user
to select or de-select a particular option.  Unlike check boxes, however,
radio buttons are mutually exclusive within a group - similar to the
buttons on old fashioned radios, when one button gets selected all the
other ones in the group get de-selected.

When using radio buttons, be sure to use the @code{Group} function in order
to tell WDS which radio buttons should be grouped together.

The @code{RadioButton} class is a subclass of @code{Control} and as such
inherits all the functionality associated with that class.  This section
only documents functionality particular to this class.

Standard control arguments are documented in the section entitled
``Standard Control Method Arguments''.

@end group
@end example
This method is used to tell WDS which radio buttons are to be considered
part of the same mutually exclusive group.  @code{id1} and @code{id2}
are the resource editor defined id's associated with the beginning and

This method is used to set the value associated with a control.  It is
often used to set the initial value prior to performing a dialog.
@code{val} should be a Dynace object which is an instance of the
@code{ShortInteger} class and initialized to the value desired for the
control.

@code{val} should represent 0 to de-select the button, 1 to select it, or 2 to
gray the button (only work on 3-state buttons).

Any previously associated object will be disposed when the new value is set.
Also, @code{val} will automatically be disposed when the control or associated
dialog is disposed.

@subsection List Boxes
@pdfsubsection{List Boxes}
The @code{ListBox} class represents a control which allows the user
to select from a list of choices.  These choices are presented in
a vertical, possibly drop down, list of text choices.  This control
supports access to the user's choice via the text option selected or
an ordinal value.

The application specifies, at runtime, the choices located in the list box.

The main difference between list boxes and combo boxes is that with list
boxes the user can only select from the available choices, however, in
addition, combo boxes allow the user to enter a choice independent of
the available options.

The @code{ListBox} class is a subclass of @code{Control} and as such
inherits all the functionality associated with that class.  This section
only documents functionality particular to this class.

Standard control arguments are documented in the section entitled
``Standard Control Method Arguments''.













@pdfsubsubsection {AddOption}

object  ctl;    /*  control object  */
char    *op;    /*  new option      */
object  r;      /*  control object  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to append a new option to the list of options associated
with a list box.  This method may be used prior to or during the execution
(via @code{gPerform}) of a dialog.

@code{op} may also be a Dynace object, an instance of the @code{String}
class, representing the new choice.  If a Dynace object is used, it must
be typecast to a string and it will be disposed when the control or
associated dialog are disposed.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  ctl;

gAddOption(ctl, "The first choice");
gAddOption(ctl, "The second choice");

@end group
@end example
This method is used to cause the automatic alphabetization of all
options added via the @code{AddOption} method.  In order to function
properly, @code{Alphabetize} must be called prior to any calls to
@code{AddOption}.  This method simply returns the object passed.

object  r;     /*  control object  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate an independent Dynace object with the
state associated with a control object.  @code{val} should be an
instance of the @code{ShortInteger} class or the @code{String} class.
This object will be automatically updated to reflect the state
associated with the control.

If @code{val} is an instance of the @code{ShortIntgeger} class it will
be used to represent the ordinal value of the selected item.  This value
is a 0 based index from the top of the list to the bottom.  -1 is used
to represent no valid selection.

If @code{val} is an instance of the @code{String} class it will be used
to represent the string represented by the user's choice.  If no choice is
made it will represent "".

This object (@code{val}) will never be disposed by WDS, even after
the control or associated dialog are disposed.  Therefore, this
is one way of gaining access to a control's value after the life
of the control.  It is the programmer's responsibility to dispose of
the object when it is no longer needed.

object  ctl, val;

@example
@group
ary = gGetSelections(ctl);

object  ctl;   /*  control object       */
object  ary;   /*  array of selections  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain an array representing the items selected
by the user.  It is most useful with list boxes which have multi-selection
enabled.  The array returned is an instance of the @code{IntegerArray} class
and @emph{must} be explicitly disposed when no longer needed.  Each element
of the array represents a zero based index of one of the user's selections,
and the size of the array represents the number of items selected.

This method may only be used while a dialog is active and will return
@code{NULL} otherwise.

This method is used to obtain a Dynace object which represents the value
associated with the control.  The object returned will be an instance of
the @code{ShortInteger} class.  The returned object will represent the
ordinal value of the choice made by the user.  This ordinal value is a
zero based index from top to bottom.  -1 indicates that no choice was
made.

This object will be disposed by WDS when the control object or
associated dialog is disposed.

method is mainly used internally.  A programmer would more often
use @code{AddControl::Dialog} to create controls and associated them
to a dialog.

long    (*func)(); /*  function pointer  */
object  r;         /*  the control obj   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate function @code{func} with the text
entry window portion of the combo box, message @code{msg} for
control @code{ctl}.  Whenever the text entry window of control
@code{ctl} receives message @code{msg}, @code{func} will be called.

@code{ctl} is the control object who's text window messages you wish to
process.  @code{msg} is the particular message you wish to trap.  These
messages are fully documented in the Windows documentation in the
Messages section.  They normally begin with @code{WM_}.

@code{func} is the function which gets called whenever the specified
message gets received and takes the following form:
@example
@group
long    func(object     ctl,
             HWND       hwnd, 
             UINT       mMsg, 
             WPARAM     wParam, 
             LPARAM     lParam)
@{
        .
        .
        .
        return 0L;  /* or whatever is appropriate  */
@}
@end group
@end example
Where @code{ctl} is the control being sent the message.  The remaining
arguments and return value is fully documented in the Windows documentation
under the @code{WindowProc} function and the Windows Messages documentation.

WDS keeps a list of functions associated with each message associated
with each control.  When a particular message is received the appropriate
list of handler functions gets executed sequentially.
@code{AddEdtHandlerAfter} appends the new function to the end of this list,
and @code{AddEdtHandlerBefore} adds the new function to the beginning of
the list.

WDS may also, and optionally, execute the Windows default procedure
associated with a given message either before or after the user added
list of functions.  This behavior may be controlled via
@code{DefaultEdtProcessingMode}.

Windows will only see the return value of the last message handler executed
including, if applicable, the default.

This method is used to append a new option to the list of options associated
with a combo box.  This method may be used prior to or during the execution
(via @code{gPerform}) of a dialog.

@code{op} may also be a Dynace object, an instance of the @code{String}
class, representing the new choice.  If a Dynace object is used, it must
be typecast to a string and it will be disposed when the control or
associated dialog are disposed.

This method is used to cause the automatic alphabetization of all

properly, @code{Alphabetize} must be called prior to any calls to
@code{AddOption}.  This method simply returns the object passed.

@end group
@end example
This method is used to associate an independent Dynace object with the
state associated with a control object.  @code{val} should be an
instance of the @code{ShortInteger} class or the @code{String} class.
This object will be automatically updated to reflect the state
associated with the control.

If @code{val} is an instance of the @code{ShortIntgeger} class it will
be used to represent the ordinal value of the selected item.  This value
is a 0 based index from the top of the list to the bottom.  -1 is used
to represent no valid selection.

If @code{val} is an instance of the @code{String} class it will be used
to represent the string represented by the user's choice.  If no choice is
made it will represent "".

This object (@code{val}) will never be disposed by WDS, even after
the control or associated dialog are disposed.  Therefore, this
is one way of gaining access to a control's value after the life
of the control.  It is the programmer's responsibility to dispose of
the object when it is no longer needed.

@end group
@end example
This method is used to determine when or if the Windows default message
procedure is processed for a given message (@code{msg}) associated with
the text entry window portion of control (@code{ctl}).

WDS allows a programmer to specify an arbitrary number of functions to
be executed whenever the text entry portion of a combo box control
receives a specific message (via @code{AddEdtHandlerAfter} and
@code{AddEdtHandlerBefore}).  Windows has default procedures associated
with many control messages.  At times it is necessary to replace or
augment this default functionality.  @code{DefaultEdtProcessingMode}
gives the programmer control over when and if this default Windows
functionality.  @code{mode} is used to specify the desired mode.  The
following table indicates the valid modes:

@table @code
@item 0
Do not execute the Windows default processing
@item 1
Execute default processing @emph{after} programmer defined handlers
@item 2
Execute default processing @emph{before} programmer defined handlers
@end table

Note that the default mode is always @code{1}, and must be explicitly
changed, if desired, for each message associated with each control.

@code{msg} is the particular message you wish to affect.  These messages
are fully documented in the Windows documentation in the Messages
section.  They normally begin with @code{WM_}.

@group

@code{min} and @code{max} are used to determine the range of the
control.  These are the values which are returned when the control
is at either end of its extremes.  The default values are 0 and
100 respectively.

@code{pginc} is used to control exactly how much the position of the
scroll bar will change when the user clicks the control in such a way
as to cause a page jump in the position.  This is normally done by
clicking in the area on either side of position indicating element of the
control.  The default value for the variable is 10.  It must be less than
the difference between @code{max} and @code{min}, and is normally larger
than @code{lineinc}.

@code{lineinc} us used to control exactly how much the position of the
scroll bar will change when the user clicks the line increment arrows
located on the extreme ends of the control.  The default value of this

@sp 2
@example
@group
c = gCopy(csr);

object  csr;    /*  cursor object          */
object  c;      /*  copy of cursor object  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create a new cursor object which is a copy of a
given cursor object.  The value of this is to be able to associate a
cursor with multiple objects which will automatically dispose of the
cursor when they are disposed.  If copies weren't used the second object
referencing the cursor would reference a disposed cursor object.

Each cursor object must be disposed (either automatically or manually)
when it is no longer needed.

r = gDispose(csr);

object  csr;   /*  a cursor object    */
object  r;     /*  NULL               */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to dispose of a cursor object when it
is no longer needed.  This method is rarely needed due to the fact that
when a window is disposed it automatically calls this method to
dispose of its associated cursor object.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.

@section Pens
@pdfsection{Pens}
The @code{Pen} class (as well as its subclasses) are used to represent
pen objects.  This class is never used by an application.  It is used
to house the functionality common to its subclasses.  Therefore, this
class documents functionality which is common to all of its subclasses.





@pdfsubsection {Common Pen Functions}




@pdfsubsubsection {Color}
@deffn {Color} Color::Pen
@sp 2
@example
@group
c = gColor(pn);

object    pn;   /*  pen object   */
COLORREF  c;    /*  pen color    */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain the color associated with a pen.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

@pdfsubsubsection {Copy}
@deffn {Copy} Copy::Pen
@sp 2
@example
@group
c = gCopy(pn);

object  pn;     /*  pen object          */
object  c;      /*  copy of pen object  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create a new pen object which is a copy of a
given pen object.  The value of this is to be able to associate a
pen with multiple objects which will automatically dispose of the
pen when they are disposed.  If copies weren't used the second object
referencing the pen would reference a disposed pen object.

Each pen object must be disposed (either automatically or manually)
when it is no longer needed.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  p1, p2;

p2 = gCopy(p1);
@end group
@end example

@example
@group
r = gDispose(pn);

object  pn;   /*  a pen object  */
object  r;    /*  NULL          */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to dispose of a pen object when it is no longer
needed.  This method is rarely needed due to the fact that when a window
or printer object is disposed it automatically calls this method to
dispose of its associated pen object.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.

@section Help System
@pdfsection{Help System}
The @code{HelpSystem} class is used to support the standard Windows
help system.  In addition to being able to support arbitrary evocation
of help messages, this class is used by other WDS classes in order to
provide complete support for context sensitive help to any level.
Each class provides mechanisms in order to associated context sensitive
help text to windows, dialogs, menus or controls.

Most classes which provide context sensitive help support have a method
called @code{SetTopic} which is used to associate a particular topic
within a given context.

All the methods in this class are class methods.  This means that
the first argument to all the methods will be @code{HelpSystem} and
there is never an instance object to keep track of.

See the appropriate examples for detailed information on how to
create the actual help file.











@pdfsubsection {HelpContents}
@deffn {HelpContents} HelpContents::HelpSystem
@sp 2
@example
@group

@code{HelpSystem} will be returned if the request is successful and
@code{NULL} otherwise.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gHelpContents(HelpSystem);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{HelpFile, HelpTopic, HelpInContext}

@group
r = gHelpFile(HelpSystem, hf);

char    *hf;    /*  help file   */
object  r;      /*  HelpSystem  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to determine the external file to be used for all help
references.  This must be done prior to any of the other help facilities
use.  The help file will not be opened until one of the help display
methods is evoked.  The application must also have a main window prior
to the evocation of the help system.  The help system will automatically
terminate when the user terminates the application.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gHelpFile(HelpSystem, "helpfile.hlp");
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{HelpContents}

@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gHelpInContext(HelpSystem);

object  r;      /*  HelpSystem  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to display the help screen associated with the
current context (set with @code{SetTopic}).  If no context is set the
help contents will be displayed.  @code{HelpSystem} will be returned if
the request is successful and @code{NULL} otherwise.

Note that @code{SetTopic} and @code{HelpInContext}, although available
to an application program, are mainly used internally by WDS in order to
support the context sensitive help facility provided by the @code{Window},
@code{Dialog}, @code{Menu}, and @code{Control} classes.  See the
@code{SetTopic} method associated with those classes.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gHelpInContext(HelpSystem);

char    *r;     /*  previous topic  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the current help topic context.  It is
used by @code{HelpInContext} to display the help text associated
with the current context.  The previous help topic will be returned.

Note that @code{SetTopic} and @code{HelpInContext}, although available
to an application program, are mainly used internally by WDS in order to
support the context sensitive help facility provided by the @code{Window},
@code{Dialog}, @code{Menu}, and @code{Control} classes.  See the
@code{SetTopic} method associated with those classes.
@example

@example
@group
hdc = gHandle(pd);

object  pd;     /*  print dialog   */
HANDLE  hdc;    /*  handle to dc   */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain the device context handle associated with
the print dialog.  It will only be valid after performing the
dialog (via @code{Perform}).  If the handle is obtained via this method,
the @code{Dispose} method will not release the handle as it would
normally do.  This is done so the device context can be used for the
printer to be opened.  If the handle as obtained it is the application's
responsibility to release the handle when it is no longer needed.  This
may be done via the @code{DeleteDC} Windows function.

This method is mainly used internally to WDS and is only made available
for convenience.
