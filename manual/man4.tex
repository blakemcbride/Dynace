@chapter Kernel Reference
@pdfchapter{Kernel Reference}
The Dynace kernel consists of the bare minimum of classes, methods, and generic
functions needed to implement the object oriented concepts discussed herein.
This chapter will discuss the structure and various facilities available in
the Dynace kernel.

Note that the first argument to all class methods is always the
associated class object and the first argument to all instance methods
is always an instance of the associated class.  Therefore, documentation
for the first argument of generics is not always given -- it's redundant.

A convention used throughout the Dynace system is for method names to start
with a capital letter and for the associated generic to have the same
name with a lower case ``g'' placed at the beginning.  Therefore, even
though this manual documents the methods, the programmer would access
the methods through their associated generics (add the ``g'').

@page
@section Kernel Class Hierarchy
@pdfsection{Kernel Class Hierarchy}
This Dynace kernel contains the following class hierarchy:
@example
@group
     Object
          Behavior
               Class
               MetaClass
          Method
          GenericFunction
          Dynace
@end group
@end example

@page
@section Object Class
@pdfsection{Object Class}
The @code{Object} Class is the root of all objects in Dynace.  It is the
last place searched when looking for a given method.  As such, the
@code{Object} Class defines the default behavior for all objects in Dynace.

@subsection Object Class Methods
@pdfsubsection{Object Class Methods}
There are no class methods defined for the @code{Object} class.

@subsection Object Instance Methods
@pdfsubsection{Object Instance Methods}
@code{Object}'s instance methods define the default behavior for all objects
in Dynace.











@pdfsubsubsection {BasicSize}
@deffn {BasicSize} BasicSize::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
sz = gBasicSize(obj);

object  obj;
int     sz;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain the entire size of an object including
all header information and instance variables.  The number returned
does not include space allocated and pointed to by the object.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  x;
int     sz;

x = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 77);
sz = gBasicSize(x);    /*  sz = 6  */
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Size::Object, InstanceSize::Behavior}
@end deffn
















@pdfsubsubsection {Compare}
@deffn {Compare} Compare::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gCompare(i, obj);

object  i;
object  obj;
int     r;
@end group
@end example
This is the default method used by the generic container classes to
determine the equality of the values represented by @code{i} and
@code{obj}.  @code{r} is -1 if the value represented by @code{i} is less
than the value represented by @code{obj}, 1 if the value of @code{i} is
greater than @code{obj}, and 0 if they are equal.

This method only compares the pointer values of the two objects and is,
therefore, usually overridden in other classes.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Hash::Object}
@end deffn












@pdfsubsubsection {Copy}
@deffn {Copy} Copy::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
new = gCopy(obj);

object  obj;
object  new;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to make a copy of an object.  A new instance
of the same class as @code{obj} is created.  Then the information
contained in @code{obj} is copied to the new object created (@code{new}).
The new object is returned.

Any classes whose instance's allocate memory may need to override this method.

This default method is the same as the @code{DeepCopy::Object} method and
would need to be overridden if they need to be different.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  x, y;

x = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 77);
y = gCopy(x);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{DeepCopy::Object, EQ, Equal::Object}
@end deffn












@pdfsubsubsection {DeepCopy}
@deffn {DeepCopy} DeepCopy::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
new = gDeepCopy(obj);

object  obj;
object  new;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to make a copy of an object.  A new instance
of the same class as @code{obj} is created.  Then the information
contained in @code{obj} is copied to the new object created (@code{new}).
The new object is returned.

Any classes whose instance's allocate memory may need to override this method.

This default method is the same as the @code{Copy::Object} method and
would need to be overridden if they need to be different.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  x, y;

x = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 77);
y = gDeepCopy(x);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Copy::Object, EQ, Equal::Object}
@end deffn









@pdfsubsubsection {DeepDispose}
@deffn {DeepDispose} DeepDispose::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDeepDispose(obj);

object  obj;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to free the storage allocated when a new object is
created.  Any class whose instances don't contain pointers to other
allocated space or references to other objects may normally just default
to this @code{DeepDispose}.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  x;

x = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 77);
x = gDeepDispose(x);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Dispose::Object, GCDispose::Object}
@end deffn





@pdfsubsubsection {Dispose}
@deffn {Dispose} Dispose::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDispose(obj);

object  obj;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to free the storage allocated when a new object is
created.  Any class whose instances don't contain pointers to allocated
space may normally just default to this @code{Dispose} for their
disposal when no longer needed.  Note that when the garbage collector
disposes of objects it calls the @code{GCDispose} method.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  x;

x = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 77);
x = gDispose(x);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{DeepDispose::Object, GCDispose::Object}
@end deffn











@pdfsubsubsection {Equal}
@deffn {Equal} Equal::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gEqual(obj1, obj2);

object  obj1, obj2;
int     r;
@end group
@end example
This method is the default method used to check two objects for equality
by comparing their contents.  1 is returned if they are of the same
class and contain the same contents and 0 otherwise.

This method should be overridden if the comparison should take
into account storage other than the local instance storage.  The
@code{String} class is a good example of this.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  a, c, c, d, e;
int     r;

a = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 77);
b = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 77);
c = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 8);
d = gNewWithInt(Dictionary, 99);
e = gCopy(b);
r = gEqual(a, a);   /*  r == 1  */
r = gEqual(a, b);   /*  r == 1  */
r = gEqual(a, c);   /*  r == 0  */
r = gEqual(a, d);   /*  r == 0  */
r = gEqual(a, e);   /*  r == 1  */
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{EQ}
@end deffn










@pdfsubsubsection {Error}
@deffn {Error} Error::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
gError(obj, msg)

object  obj;
char    *msg;  /*  Error message  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to display an error message (@code{msg} using
@code{Puts::Stream} and @code{stderrStream}) and abort the
program.  @code{msg} may also be an instance of @code{String}.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gError(Dynace, "Out of memory.\n");
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Puts::Stream, stderrStream}
@end deffn













@pdfsubsubsection {GCDispose}
@deffn {GCDispose} GCDispose::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gGCDispose(obj);

object  obj;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to free the storage allocated when a new object is
created.  This is a special type of dispose method which should only be
called by the garbage collector in Dynace.  The @code{GCDispose} method
must be defined for any class whose instances contain allocated space.
It should unregister any registered memory associated with the object,
free the allocated space and then call the super @code{GCDispose}.  It
must not free any objects which are referenced, either directly or
indirectly, by the object being disposed of.

This default method simply disposes of the individual object.
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Dispose::Object, DeepDispose::Object}
@end deffn





@pdfsubsubsection {Hash}
@deffn {Hash} Hash::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
val = gHash(i);

object  i;
int     val;
@end group
@end example
This is the default method used by the generic container classes to
obtain hash values for the object.  @code{val} is a hash value between 0
and a large integer value.

This default method only hashes on the pointer value of the object,
therefore, it is normally overridden in other classes.

@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Compare::Object}
@end deffn









@pdfsubsubsection {Init}
@deffn {Init} Init::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gInit(obj);

object  obj;
object  r;
@end group
@end example
This method is used as the default object initialization method for new
objects when used in conjunction with @code{Alloc::Behavior}.  The
default behavior is to do nothing, therefore, this method does nothing
but return its argument.  Normally, classes would redefine this method
to perform some class specific useful initialization.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  x;

x = gInit(gAlloc(MyClass));
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Alloc::Behavior, New::Behavior}
@end deffn














@pdfsubsubsection {IsKindOf}
@deffn {IsKindOf} IsKindOf::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gIsKindOf(obj, cls);

object  obj;
object  cls;
int     r;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to determine if class @code{cls} is the class of
or a superclass of @code{obj}.  If so a 1 is returned and 0 otherwise.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  a, b;
int     c;

a = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 7);
b = gNewWithInt(Dictionary, 101);
c = gIsKindOf(a, ShortInteger);  /* c == 1  */
c = gIsKindOf(a, LongInteger);   /* c == 0  */
c = gIsKindOf(b, Dictionary);    /* c == 1  */
c = gIsKindOf(b, Set);           /* c == 1  */
c = gIsKindOf(b, LinkList);      /* c == 0  */
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{IsKindOf::Behavior, IsInstanceOf, ClassOf}
@end deffn












@pdfsubsubsection {Print}
@deffn {Print} Print::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
ret = gPrint(obj, stm);

object  obj;
object  stm;
object  ret;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to print out a representation of an object
and its value to stream @code{stm}.  It evokes @code{StringRep}
on @code{obj} in order to obtain a printable representation of
the object.

The returned value is just @code{obj}.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  x;

x = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 77);
gPrint(x, stdoutStream);
/* this would print something like:  
      ShortInteger:<0x0034:4721> [ 77 ] */
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{PrintValue::Object, StringRepValue::Object, stdoutStream}
@end deffn










@pdfsubsubsection {PrintValue}
@deffn {PrintValue} PrintValue::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
ret = gPrintValue(obj, stm);

object  obj;
object  stm;
object  ret;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to print out a representation of an object's
value to stream @code{stm}.  It evokes @code{StringRepValue}
on @code{obj} in order to obtain a printable representation of
the object.

The returned value is just @code{obj}.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  x;

x = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 77);
gPrintValue(x, stdoutStream);
/* this would print something like:  77  */
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Print::Object, StringRepValue::Object, stdoutStream}
@end deffn










@pdfsubsubsection {ShouldNotImplement}
@deffn {ShouldNotImplement} ShouldNotImplement::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
gShouldNotImplement(obj, meth)

object  obj;
char    *meth;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to display an error message indicating that the
class of @code{obj} (or any of its subclasses) should not implement
method @code{meth}.  @code{meth} is the name of the method.

This method may be useful to help catch class misuse by users of a
class.  It issues a helpful message when attempting to use a class
inappropriately.

The message is output via @code{Error::Object} which also aborts the
program.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Error::Object}
@end deffn















@pdfsubsubsection {Size}
@deffn {Size} Size::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
sz = gSize(obj);

object  obj;
int     sz;
@end group
@end example
This is the default method used to obtain the size of an object.
It returns the total number of bytes use by the objects instance variables.
This method is often overridden.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  x;
int     sz;

x = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 77);
sz = gSize(x);    /*  sz = 2  */
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{BasicSize::Object}
@end deffn












@pdfsubsubsection {StringRep}
@deffn {StringRep} StringRep::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gStringRep(i);

object  i;
object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to provide a default format for the display of
instance objects.  It creates an instance of the @code{String} class
which represents the class of the object, its address and value.  The
value is obtained by calling the object's @code{StringRepValue} method.
This is often used to print or display a representation of an object.
It is also used by by @code{Print::Object} (a method useful during the
debugging phase of a project) in order to directly print an object to a
stream.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Print::Object, PrintValue::Object, StringRepValue::Object}
@end deffn











@pdfsubsubsection {StringRepValue}
@deffn {StringRepValue} StringRepValue::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gStringRepValue(i);

object  i;
object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to provide a default mechanism for creating an
instance of the @code{String} class for the display of instance object's
values.  It displays the class of the object, and its address.  This
method is called by the @code{StringRep} method to obtain the value of
the object and is normally overridden by particular classes.

It is also used by @code{PrintValue::Object} and indirectly by
@code{Print::Object} (two methods useful during the debugging phase of a
project) in order to directly print an object's value.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{PrintValue::Object, Print::Object}
@end deffn















@pdfsubsubsection {SubclassResponsibility}
@deffn {SubclassResponsibility} SubclassResponsibility::Object
@sp 2
@example
@group
gSubclassResponsibility(obj, meth)

object  obj;
char    *meth;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to display an error message indicating that method
@code{meth} should be implemented by a subclass of the class of
@code{obj}.  @code{meth} is the name of the method.

This method may be useful when grouping common interfaces in an
abstract class to insure that its subclasses implement the correct
methods.

The message is output via @code{Error::Object} which also aborts the
program.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Error::Object}
@end deffn










@page
@section Behavior Class
@pdfsection{Behavior Class}
The @code{Behavior} Class is used to define the default behavior
common to @code{Class} and @code{MetaClass} type objects.

@subsection Behavior Class Methods
@pdfsubsection{Behavior Class Methods}
There are no class methods defined for the @code{Behavior} class.

@subsection Behavior Instance Methods
@pdfsubsection{Behavior Instance Methods}
@code{Behavior}'s instance methods define the default behavior common to all
@code{Class} and @code{MetaClass} type objects.





@pdfsubsubsection {Alloc}
@deffn {Alloc} Alloc::Behavior
@sp 2
@example
@group
obj = gAlloc(cls);

object  cls;
object  obj;
@end group
@end example
This method creates instances of class type objects.  The
returned value is an instance of class @code{cls}.  All instance
variables in the @code{obj} object are initialized to NULL or 0.

This method works exactly like @code{New::Behavior} except that it
is not normally redefined by subclasses.  @code{Alloc} is strictly
used to allocate new instances without also initializing them.
@code{Init::Object} would be defined and called to initialize the
object.  Conceptually, @code{New::Behavior} should be equivalent to
calling @code{Alloc} and @code{Init}.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  x;

x = gInit(gAlloc(MyClass));
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Init::Object, New::Behavior, StackAlloc macro}
@end deffn






@pdfsubsubsection {DoesNotImplement}
@deffn {DoesNotImplement} DoesNotImplement::Behavior
@sp 2
@example
@group
gDoesNotImplement(cls, gen);

object  cls;
object  gen;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to issue an error message when there is an attempt 
to execute a generic function (@code{gen}) for class @code{cls}.
The message prints to standard error (@code{stderr}) and exits the program.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gDoesNotImplement(MyClass, Generic(MyGeneric));
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{RespondesTo, InvalidObject::Method}
@end deffn











@pdfsubsubsection {DontCollect}
@deffn {DontCollect} DontCollect::Behavior
@sp 2
@example
@group
obj = gDontCollect(cls);

object  cls;
object  obj;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to turn garbage collection off for a single
class of objects.  It doesn't effect any of its superclasses or subclasses and
has no effect of garbage collection is not being used.  It returns
@code{cls}.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

gDontCollect(ShortInteger);
@end group
@end example
@c @sp 1
@c See also:  @code{}
@end deffn












@pdfsubsubsection {FindMethod}
@deffn {FindMethod} FindMethod::Behavior
@sp 2
@example
@group
meth = gFindMethod(cls, gen, lev)

object  cls;    /* class                */
object  gen;    /* the generic object   */
int     lev;    /* search level         */
object  (*meth)();  /*  method          */
@end group
@end example
This method may be used to find the correct method associated with a
particular generic--class combination.  @code{gen} is the generic
function object (not a pointer to the generic function).  @code{cls} is
the class where the search should start and @code{lev} tells whether
this is a regular or superclass type search.  1 is regular and 2
indicates a superclass search.

A pointer to the C function which implements the method is returned.  If no
method is found @code{NULL} is returned.

There also exists a function named @code{_FindMethod} which works
similar to @code{gFindMethod} except it issues an error message if no
method is found.  @code{_FindMethod} is the one which does all the work
to find the correct method associated with a particular generic--class
combination when executing generics.

@code{FindMethod} should not be called by an application.  The relevant
macros should be used instead.

There is a similar method called @code{FindMethodObject::Behavior} which
returns the method object instead of the C function pointer which
implements the method.
@c @example
@c @group

int     lev;    /* search level         */
object  meth;   /*  method          */
@end group
@end example
This method may be used to find the correct
method associated with a particular generic--class combination.
@code{gen} is the generic function object (not a pointer to the generic
function).  @code{cls} is the class where the search should start and
@code{lev} tells whether this is a regular or superclass type search.
1 is regular and 2 indicates a superclass search.

This method return the method object found.  If no method is found
@code{NULL} is returned.

There is a similar method called @code{FindMethod::Behavior} which
returns the C function which implements the method instead of the method
object.

@end example
This method is used to obtain the total size a direct instances of class
@code{cls} would be.  This includes space used by the instance variables
defined in class @code{cls} as well as all the superclasses of
@code{cls}.

@end example
This method is used to determine if class @code{cls2} is a
superclass of @code{cls1}.  If so a 1 is returned and 0 otherwise.
A 1 will also be returned if @code{cls1} is the same class as @code{cls2}.

This method is used to specify an additional marking method to be used
by the garbage collector.  It should only be needed in extremely special
cases.  After the garbage collector marks all used objects it checks
for any classes which have a special marking method.  The special
marking method would normally mark additional objects which are accessed
in a very unusual way.

@sp 2
@example
@group
obj = gNew(cls);
     or

object  cls;
object  obj;
@end group
@end example
This is the method which creates instances of class type objects.  The
returned value is an instance of class @code{cls}.  All @code{New}
methods call this method.  All instance variables in the @code{obj}
object are initialized to NULL or 0.  This method is often redefined in
particular classes so that instance variables may be set to appropriate
initial values.

Both @code{gNew} and @code{vNew} are associated with this method.
@example
@group

object  x;

x = gNew(LinkList);

@sp 2
@example
@group
obj = gStackAlloc(cls, ptr);

object  cls;
void    *ptr;
object  obj;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to turn arbitrary storage pointed to by @code{ptr}
into an instance of @code{cls}.  The storage is assumed to be large
enough (the value returned by @hfil @break @code{InstanceSize::Behavior}).
The object returned will function as a normal object except that when it
is disposed (via @code{gDispose}, etc.) no actual freeing of the object
will occur.  However, user defined disposal code will be utilized.

This facility is currently only used to allocate objects from the
stack.  The cover macro, @code{StackAlloc}, should be used instead
of this method.

This method is used to generate an instance of the @code{String} class
which represents the object @code{i} and its value.  The @code{String}
contains the name of the class, and its address.  It then calls the
@code{StringRepValue} method to obtain its contents.  This is often used
to print or display a representation of a class object.  It is also used
by by @code{Print::Object} (a method useful during the debugging phase
of a project) in order to directly print an object to a stream.

int     pm;     /*  previous trace mode  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to set the trace mode associated with a
particular class (@code{cls}).  This mode only has an effect when
the Dynace tracing facility is activated (via @code{Trace::Dynace}).
The possible settings (defined in @code{dynl.h}) are as follows:
@example
@group

The @code{Class} Class is mainly used for the creation of new class objects.


@subsection Class Class Methods
@pdfsubsection{Class Class Methods}
The only class methods in the class @code{Class} are used to create new
class objects and find class objects.







@pdfsubsubsection {FindClass}
@deffn {FindClass} FindClass::Class
@sp 2
@example
@group
cls = gFindClass(Class, cname)

char    *cname; /*  the name of the class  */
object  cls;    /*  The class found        */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to find a class object from its name.  The requested
class is returned or @code{NULL} if it doesn't exist.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  cls;

cls = gFindClass(Class, "Set");
@end group
@end example
@c @sp 1

@pdfsubsubsection {GetAll}
@deffn {GetAll} GetAll::Class
@sp 2
@example
@group
cl = gGetAll(Class);

object  cl;     /*  LinkObject of all class objects  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to get a linked list (of type @code{LinkObject})
of all the class objects (classes).  It is useful for enumerating through
all the class objects.  Once a class object is obtained, it
can be used to obtain information about the class.

Once @code{cl} is no longer needed it is important that it is
disposed with @code{gDispose} and not @code{gDeepDispose}.  Use
of @code{gDeepDispose} on @code{cl} will dispose of all the class
objects in the system and crash it.
@c @example
@c @group

@pdfsubsubsection {NewClass}
@deffn {NewClass} NewClass::Class
@sp 2
@example
@group
cls = gNewClass(Class, cname, ivsize, cvsize, superClasses...)

char    *cname; /*  the name of the new class    */
int     ivsize; /*  the size of the instance variables in 
                    the new class  */
int     cvsize; /*  the size of the class variables  */
object  superClasses;  /*  an END terminated list of 
                           superclasses  */
object  cls;    /*  The new class being created  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create new classes.  It automatically creates the
class object, the metaclass object associated with the new class object
and sets up all the necessary internal pointers and data structures.

The @code{name} parameter is the name associated with the new class.
The metaclass created will have the same name with ``meta'' prepended
to the name.  

The @code{ivsize} parameter defines the size of the locally
declared instance variables associated with the new class.  If there are
no local instance variables @code{0} should be used.  

The @code{cvsize} parameter is used to declare the size of the locally
defined class variables associated with the new class.  If there are no
locally defined class variables @code{0} should be used, otherwise, the
size of the class variable structure should be used.

The remainder of this method's arguments define the superclasses the new
class will have.  The last argument must be @code{END}.  If no superclasses
are defined the single class @code{Object} will be the default
superclass.  The order of the superclasses will determine the method
lookup order.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  NewClass;

NewClass = gNewClass(Class, ShortInteger, END);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1

@pdfsubsubsection {NewStdClass}
@deffn {NewStdClass} NewStdClass::Class
@sp 2
@example
@group
cls = gNewStdClass(Class, cname, ivsize, mclass, nipib,
                   sCls...)

char    *cname; /*  the name of the new class    */
int     ivsize; /*  the size of the instance variables in 
                    the new class  */
object  mclass; /*  the metaclass of the new class  */
int     nipib;  /*  number of instances per instance block  */
object  sCls;   /*  an END terminated list of 
                           superclasses  */
object  cls;    /*  The new class being created  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create new classes.  Unlike @code{NewClass::Class},
which automatically creates a corresponding metaclass (like Smalltalk
-- more convenient), @code{NewStdClass::Class} creates single independent
classes with the ability to set the metaclass (like CLOS -- more
powerful but more cumbersome to use).

The @code{name} parameter is the name associated with the new class.

The @code{ivsize} parameter defines the size of the locally
declared instance variables associated with the new class.  If there are
no local instance variables @code{0} should be used.  

The @code{mclass} parameter is used to set the class of the newly
created class.  This is the class which defines the behavior and
characteristics of the newly created class.  Note that any number
of classes may share the same metaclass.  This adds a great deal
of power to the meta-language aspects of the system.

For efficiency reasons Dynace does not allocate memory for objects
one at a time.  They are allocated in blocks which are measured
by the number of instances per block of memory.  This factor
may be specified by the use of the @code{nipib} parameter.  When
creating a class which will have many small instances used it
is best to have @code{nipib} high (~50).  However, if the instances
are large and there will only be a few of them 1 would be a good choice.
The use of 0 will cause the system to estimate an appropriate value
based on the instance size.

The remainder of this method's arguments define the superclasses the new
class will have.  The last argument must be @code{END}.  If no superclasses
are defined the single class @code{Object} will be the default
superclass.  The order of the superclasses will determine the method
lookup order.

@section Dynace Class
@pdfsection{Dynace Class}
The @code{Dynace} Class is used to affect various parameters which control
the internal operation of the Dynace kernel.  The user may control whether
the garbage collector is activated or not and what parameters it is
running under.  You may also control such things as the size of the
method cache.  All operations performed through this class are performed
by sending messages directly to the Dynace class.  There are no instance
methods.


@subsection Dynace Class Methods

This method is used to change the memory region associated with
a memory region pointer.  @code{rmp} must have been a pointer returned by
@code{gRegisterMemory}.

This method is used to obtain the current amount of storage being used
by Dynace objects.  This number increases every time a new object is
created, and decreases every time an object is disposed.
@example
@group

@end group
@end example
This method is used to dump a list of all Dynace objects in a human
readable format into the file named by @code{file}.  The @code{mc}
flag is used to determine whether or not metaclasses are included
in the dump.

This method is mainly used to find leaks in an application.  Typically,
a body of code would be run, then an object dump performed, then run again,
and finally a second object dump to another file is performed.  The two
dump files would then be sorted and diff'ed.  A list of object leaks
would result.

This method is used to create a string dictionary representing
the difference between two calls to @code{gDumpObjectsString}.
The string is the name of the class and
the value is an instance of @code{LongInteger} which represents the
number of instances different.

This method is mainly used to find leaks in an application.  Typically,
a body of code would be run, then an object dump performed, then run
again, and finally a second object dump is performed.  The two dump
string dictionaries would then be compared using

This method is used to force the Dynace system to perform a garbage collection.
All inaccessible objects will be collected and made available for reuse.
This method is not normally used because the Dynace system will automatically

This method is used to obtain the maximum memory that was in use
immediately after the last garbage collection.  If no garbage
collection has taken place the returned value will represent
the current memory usage.  The value of this number is that
the amount of storage between the current memory usage and this number
is considered potential garbage and used (internally) by Dynace
to help determine when an automatic garbage collection should occur.

int     flag;   /*  1=on,  0=off   */
object  c;      /*  the Dynace class  */
@end group
@end example
Since the first argument to all generics is the Dynace object which is
being sent the message, the first argument to all generics must always
be a valid Dynace object.  Whenever a generic is called Dynace verifies that
the first argument is in fact a valid Dynace object.  If it is not Dynace
will issue an error message and abort the program.  This is a fatal
error.

There is a runtime overhead associated with this check.  It's very
similar to the stack checking which some C compilers perform at
runtime.  Once a program is sufficiently debugged it is possible
to turn this runtime checking off in order to achieve maximum
performance.  Turning the checking off is, however, not recommended.
If an untested portion of code which contains a bug is executed
and the checking is off very unpredictable results will occur.
It's very similar to dereferencing an uninitialized pointer in C.

There are techniques to totally eliminate the runtime overhead
associated with object validation and method lookup within Dynace.
See the text.

By default Dynace has object checking turned on.  The @code{ObjectChecking}
method may be called at arbitrary points in a program to turn the checking
on or off.  A @code{flag} value of 1 turns checking on and a value of 0
turns it off.
@example
@group

void    *beg;   /*  beginning of registered memory  */
long    size;   /*  size of region      */
void    *rmp;   /*  registered memory pointer  */
@end group
@end example
The Dynace garbage collector uses the C stack in order to determine which
objects are still accessible, either directly or indirectly, by the
program and need to be saved.  All remaining objects will be collected
and returned to the free store.  This scheme allows Dynace to automatically
handle objects which are being referenced, directly or indirectly, by
automatic variables and function parameters.

Dynace has no way of knowing about objects which are referenced by global
and static variables or objects which are being referenced by memory
allocated from the heap.  If an objects is only being referenced by
one of these methods Dynace will dispose of it the next time the
garbage collector is called.  If the program later tries to use the
object an error will occur.  The solution to this problem is to
register these memory regions with Dynace.

The @code{beg} parameter specifies the address of the beginning of the
region which needs to be protected.  The @code{size} parameter specifies
the size in bytes of the region.  @code{RegisterMemory} returns a pointer
which may be used to un-register the region at a later time.

The @code{RegisterVariable} macro provides a convenient interface
to protect global and static variables.

If the Dynace garbage collector is not being used there is no need to
register any memory regions.

@example
@group
@exdent Example:

static  object  a, b;

gRegisterMemory(Dynace, &a, (long) sizeof(a));
RegisterVariable(b);
@end group

@sp 2
@example
@group
gRemoveRegisteredMemory(Dynace, rmp)

void    *rmp;   /*  registered memory pointer  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to remove a memory region from those registered
with the Dynace system.  The @code{rmp} parameter must be a pointer
which was obtained from a call to @code{gRegisterMemory}.  Once
this method is called the specified region of memory will no longer
be protected from the garbage collector.
@example

int     nGenerics;      /*  size of generic cache table */
object  c;              /*  the Dynace class  */
@end group
@end example
The first time a particular method is evoked it must be searched for
as described elsewhere in this manual.  This is a time consuming
process.  It is, however, necessary for this process to occur at runtime
in order to obtain the true benefit of Object Oriented Programming.
C++, Objective--C, and Smalltalk all perform this search when using their
dynamic binding capabilities.

Once the appropriate method is found it is placed in a fast cache
automatically maintained by Dynace.  This cache is designed such that
it never overflows.  It just grows on an as-needed basis.  Therefore,
once a correct method is found it will never be searched for again.
All future messages to that particular method will be found in the
cache.

When Dynace is initialized a default cache is established.  Under normal
circumstances you may never need to be concerned with the cache at
all.  However, under conditions where there are a very large number
of classes or generics it may be beneficial to enlarge the cache
table sizes.

If the cache size is to be changed the best place to do it is immediately
after the initialization of Dynace.  You could, however, change the cache size
at any point at the one time cost of some additional CPU time.

The @code{nClasses} parameter should be set to some number larger than
the total number of classes in your program.  The @code{nGenerics}
parameter should also be set to some number larger than the number of
generics in the program.  These numbers may be set lower than the
number of classes and/or generics in order to save memory at the
relatively low cost of runtime speed.  Since the cache is implemented
as a hash table choosing numbers that are prime is best.
Choosing odd numbers is good too.

There are techniques to totally eliminate the runtime overhead
associated with object validation and method lookup within Dynace.
See the text.

c = gSetMemoryBufferArea(Dynace, size)

long    size;   /*  size of buffer area  */
object  c;      /*  the Dynace class  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to activate and control the automatic operation of the
Dynace garbage collector.  When Dynace is first started the default memory buffer
area is set to -1.  This value indicates that Dynace should not automatically
start the garbage collector.

If the value of @code{size} is positive then Dynace will automatically
start the garbage collector every time the program creates enough
@emph{new} objects to exceed the storage specified by the @code{size}
parameter (in bytes).  Dynace will automatically adjust its heap storage
requirements based on the @code{size} parameter and the storage history
of the application program.

The actual value of @code{size} must be determined experimentally.
A typical starting place would be about 40000.  The higher the value of
@code{size} the less frequently the garbage collector will be started
but the longer it will take to run.  The lower the value of @code{size}
the more often the garbage collector will run but also the faster.
The garbage collector is very fast and you will probably not notice much
of a difference for a wide range of @code{size}.

The typical storage Dynace requires to support this facility is roughly
equal to the maximum storage of all the active objects in the
application at any given time plus the value of the @code{size}
parameter.  Therefore, making @code{size} unnecessarily large would
be wasteful.

Note that the @code{size} parameter must be of type @code{long}.

@page
@section Kernel Macros
@pdfsection{Kernel Macros}
Dynace has a number of macros to simplify the creation and usage of objects.
These macros are all defined in the file @code{dynl.h}.  The following
text describe each macro.











@pdfsubsection {accessIVs}
@deffn {accessIVs} accessIVs
@sp 2
@example
@group
accessIVs;
@end group
@end example
This macro is used to access the instance variables from within an
instance method.  It may be used anywhere within the variable
declaration section of a normal C function.  @code{accessIVs} actually
declares a local variable named @code{iv} and initializes it to a
pointer to the instance variable structure.  Once @code{accessIVs} is
called the local variable @code{iv} may be used to access all the
locally defined instance variables in the class being defined in the
current file.

@code{accessIVs} uses the variable named @code{self} to determine which
object to obtain instance variables for.  See @code{ivPtr} to access
instance variables for other variables.

If an instance method makes only a single access to its instance variables
the use of the @code{ivsPtr} macro would be better suited.

Note that it is rarely ever necessary to explicitly use the
@code{accessIVs} macro due to the fact the the Dynace preprocessor
(@code{dpp}) automatically adds this code when preprocessing the class
definition file.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

defclass  @{
      char    name[30];
      int     age;
@};

imeth void    PrintInstances(object self, FILE *fp)
@{
      accessIVs;

      fprintf(fp, "%s is %d years old\n", iv->name, iv->age);

ChkArg(arg, argn);

object  arg;    /*  the argument to be checked  */
int     argn;   /*  the argument number         */
@end group
@end example
This macro provides a convenient way of validating method arguments.
If @code{arg} is not a valid Dynace object a meaningful error message
will be displayed and the program will be aborted.  @code{argn} is
used in the error message to tell which argument caused the problem.

The argument checking properties of this macro may be enabled / disabled
via the @code{gObjectChecking} generic.  It defaults to ON.

Since Dynace automatically checks the first argument to all generics (if
argument checking is on) there is never a need to manually check the
first argument.  @code{ChkArg} would only be needed for arguments
beyond the first.

@code{ChkArg} may only be used as the first executable statements in a
method (prior to any other generic calls).
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

imeth object  MyMethod(object self, object arg2, object arg3)

object  arg;    /*  the argument to be checked  */
int     argn;   /*  the argument number         */
@end group
@end example
This macro provides a convenient way of validating method arguments.
Unlike @code{ChkArg} this will also permit an argument of @code{NULL}.
If @code{arg} is not a valid Dynace object (or @code{NULL}) a meaningful
error message will be displayed and the program will be aborted.
@code{argn} is used in the error message to tell which argument caused
the problem.

The argument checking properties of this macro may be enabled / disabled
via the @code{gObjectChecking} generic.  It defaults to ON.

Since Dynace automatically checks the first argument to all generics (if

will be displayed and the program will be aborted.  @code{argn} is
used in the error message to tell which argument caused the problem.

@code{type} is used to specify the expected type of the argument.  If
@code{arg} is not an instance of class @code{type} (or one of its
subclasses) an error message will be displayed and the program will be
aborted.  If no argument type checking is required @code{type} should
be passed a @code{NULL} and no type checking will be performed.

The argument checking properties of this macro may be enabled / disabled
via the @code{gObjectChecking} generic.  It defaults to ON.

Since Dynace automatically checks the first argument to all generics (if
argument checking is on) there is never a need to manually check the
first argument.  @code{ChkArgTyp} would only be needed for arguments
beyond the first.

@code{ChkArgTyp} may only be used as the first executable statements in a
method (prior to any other generic calls).

This macro provides a very fast way of obtaining the class of any object.
Since all objects in Dynace (including classes) are also regular objects and
since all objects are instances of some class the @code{ClassOf} macro
may be called repeatedly and indefinitely for any Dynace object and you
would always receive a valid object.  This macro may also be used to
map any class hierarchy.

This macro returns the class method associated with class @code{cls} and
generic function @code{gen}.  The normal runtime search is used to
obtain the method.  The process performed by this macro accounts for all
the additional runtime overhead associated with the runtime binding of
Dynace generic function usage.  The method pointer returned may be used as
a normal C function pointer, thus nullifying all future runtime overhead
associated with dynamic binding.  This macro may therefore be used to
locally cache a method and eliminate any runtime costs while retaining
the full dynamic capabilities of Dynace.

This macro correctly typecasts its returned pointer to agree with
the associated generic's return type and argument list.

The use of this macro should be used sparingly.  It is a little
cumbersome to use and, if not used with care, may defeat the dynamic
nature and benefits of dynamic binding.  However, if used appropriately
(in tight loops where efficiency is important), this macro may be
a valuable tool.

This macro returns a pointer to the C function which implements the method.

This macro is used to associate a C function, which implements a
class method, with a generic function for class @code{cls}.  It is
normally only used within the class initialization function associated

This macro returns a Dynace object (an instance of the Method class) which
represents the C function which implements the method.  Each Class 
and Generic object contains a list of Method objects which it relates
to so there is not normally a need to save the returned value.

The difference between this macro and @code{cMethodFor} is the extra @code{ff}
parameter.  When using @code{dpp} strategies other then 1 (see the @code{dpp}
section) under certain circumstance @code{dpp} will alter the argument
signature of the defined method in order to accommodate the non-assembler
generic / method interface.  It will then create a new function which has
the correct signature in case the programmer requests a pointer to the
method.  This way the returned function pointer will match the argument
signature defined in the class definition file.  @code{ff} is a pointer
to this cover function.

@code{GetArg} may be used anytime subsequent to the @code{MAKE_REST}

object  (*ff)();        /*  fixed C function    */
object  meth;           /*  method object       */
@end group
@end example
This macro is used to associate a C function, which implements an
instance method, with a generic function for class @code{cls}.  It is
normally only used within the class initialization function associated
with each class file.

This macro returns a Dynace object (an instance of the Method class) which
represents the C function which implements the method.  Each Class 
and Generic object contains a list of Method objects which it relates
to so there is not normally a need to save the returned value.

The difference between this macro and @code{iMethodFor} is the extra @code{ff}
parameter.  When using @code{dpp} strategies other then 1 (see the @code{dpp}
section) under certain circumstance @code{dpp} will alter the argument
signature of the defined method in order to accommodate the non-assembler
generic / method interface.  It will then create a new function which has
the correct signature in case the programmer requests a pointer to the
method.  This way the returned function pointer will match the argument
signature defined in the class definition file.  @code{ff} is a pointer
to this cover function.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

ivMethodFor(MyClass, gChangeValue, my_change, f_my_change);
@end group

@pdfsubsection {ivPtr}
@deffn {ivPtr} ivPtr
@sp 2
@example
@group
iv = ivPtr(i);

object  i;
ivType  *iv;
@end group
@end example
The @code{ivPtr} macro returns a pointer to the locally defined
instance variable structure associated with instance @code{i}.  It is
used to gain access to the instance variables associated with the
instance object pointed to by the @code{i} variable.  It may only be
used in a file which defines a class and @code{i} must be an instance
of the class being defined or one of its subclasses.

If the method is going to make more than one access to its instances
variables the pointer returned by @code{ivPtr} should normally be saved
and reused.

If the variable containing the instance variables you wish to access is
named @code{self} than the @code{ivsPtr} or @code{accessIVs} macro
should be used.

Although the example below makes its illustration with the @code{self}
variable (because it's always the name of the first argument to a
method) @code{ivPtr} is most often used to access the instance variables
of a second argument (which wouldn't have the name @code{self}) which is
an instance of the same (or sub) class.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

defclass  @{
    char    name[30];
    int     age;
@};

imeth object  PrintAge(object self)
@{
    printf("Age = %d\n", ivPtr(self)->age);
    return self;

    ivType  *iv = ivPtr(self);      /*  save the pointer */
/* the above line is the same as accessIVs  */
    printf("Name = %s\n", iv->name); /* use saved pointer   */
    printf("Age = %d\n", iv->age);

@pdfsubsection {ivsPtr}
@deffn {ivsPtr} ivsPtr
@sp 2
@example
@group
iv = ivsPtr;

ivType  *iv;
@end group
@end example
The @code{ivsPtr} macro returns a pointer to the locally defined
instance variable structure for the variable named @code{self}.  It is
used to gain access to the instance variables associated with the
instance object pointed to by the @code{self} variable.  It may only be
used in instance methods, in a file which defines a class.

This macro is typically used when an instance method makes a single
access to its instance variables.  If the method is going to make more
than one access to its instances variables the macro @code{accessIVs}
would normally be used or the pointer returned by @code{ivsPtr}
would normally be saved and reused.

If the variable containing the instance variables you wish to access
is not named @code{self} than the @code{ivPtr} macro should be used.
@example
@group

@sp 2
@example

ivType
@end group
@end example
This macro is used to declare a variable to be of a structure which is defined
by the local instance variable declaration.  It can only be used in a source
file which is used to define a class and only of the structure of the locally
defined instance variable structure.  It's main use is while passing a pointer
to a local variable structure to other, usually statically defined, C functions
within a class definition file.
@example

@pdfsubsection {MAKE_REST}
@deffn {MAKE_REST} MAKE_REST
@sp 2
@example
@group
MAKE_REST(lst);
@end group
@end example
This macro is used in conjunction with the @code{GetArg} macro in order
to create a consistent mechanism for methods which take a variable
number of arguments to obtain its optional arguments.  This mechanism,
as opposed to the normal @code{va_*} mechanism, is necessary in order to
allow the same source code to work across the various @code{dpp} code
strategies (see the @code{dpp} subsection ``Preprocessing Strategies'').

Methods which take a variable number of arguments and wish to access
those arguments must use the @code{MAKE_REST} macro.  This macro must
exist immediately following the declaration section of the method and
prior to the normal executable code.

@code{MAKE_REST} takes a single argument which must be the last named
argument in the method's argument list.  The result of calling
@code{MAKE_REST} is the creation of a variable named @code{_rest_}
which acts as a pointer to the variable argument list, a
@code{va_list}.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

imeth  gChangeValue(int a, char *b, ...)
{
        double  var1;
        int     dd;

@sp 2
@example
@group
r = NEQ(obj1, obj2);

object  obj1, obj2;
int     r;
@end group
@end example
This macro is used to determine if @code{obj1} and @code{obj2} refer to
the same exact object (not just the same value within the object).  If
so a 0 is returned and 1 otherwise.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  a, b, e;
int     c;

a = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 7);
b = gNewWithInt(ShortInteger, 7);

@group
meth = oSuper(cls, gen, obj);

object  cls;
RTYPE   (*gen)();
object  obj;     
RTYPE   (*meth)();
@end group
@end example
This macro returns the superclass instance or class method associated
with the generic function @code{gen} for class @code{cls}.  @code{obj}
is used to tell whether the object being acted upon is a class or
instance object.  It should be the argument which will be the first
argument to the methods being returned.  If the method is not found the
normal method search procedure will be used.

@code{RTYPE} is the return type associated with the generic and
macro in question.  The method pointer returned will be correctly
typecast.

This macro effectively eliminates the need for the @code{iSuper} or
@code{cSuper} macros.  
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

 /* execute the superclass
    method associated with gDispose

@end example
The @code{RegisterVariable} macro is used as a short hand way of
registering global object variables to protect them from the
automatic garbage collector.  @code{v} is the global variable to be
protected and @code{p} is a registered memory pointer which may
be used to change or delete the registration at some later point.

@end group
@end example
This macro is used in conjunction with the @code{GetArg} and
@code{MAKE_REST} macros in order
to create a consistent mechanism for methods which take a variable
number of arguments to obtain its optional arguments.  This macro
allows the @code{GetArg} to go back over the argument list from
the beginning, thus allowing multiple passes over the entire
argument list.  @code{RESET_REST} may be called anytime, and any
number of times, after @code{MAKE_REST} has been called.  Each time
@code{RESET_REST} is called, @code{GetArg} will start back at the
beginning of the argument list.
@example

@deffn {StackAlloc} StackAlloc
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = StackAlloc(cls);

object  cls;
object  i;
@end group
@end example
This macro is used to allocate a new instance of class @code{cls} from
the local stack space.  @code{i} will be an instance of class @code{cls}
with all its instance variables initialized to @code{NULL}.

Disposal of the returned object will occur automatically when the local
stack is exited, however, no automatic execution of additional disposal
code will occur.  Manual disposal may also be used (via @code{gDispose},
etc.) but the object will still take up stack space until the stack
frame is exited.

Since the returned object is allocated from the current stack frame
it cannot be returned from the function which allocated it.

This facility depends on a robust implementation of the @code{alloca}
system call.
